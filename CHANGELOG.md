## [3.1.0] - 2021-10-12

### Added

- New index class `HeadIndex` (configuration: [`dipdup.config.HeadIndexConfig`](https://github.com/dipdup-io/dipdup/blob/master/src/dipdup/config.py#L778)). Use this index type to handle head (limited block header content) updates. This index type is realtime-only: historical data won't be indexed during the synchronization stage.
- Added three new commands: `schema approve`, `schema wipe`, and `schema export`. Run `dipdup schema --help` command for details.

### Changed

- Triggering reindexing won't lead to dropping the database automatically anymore. `ReindexingRequiredError` is raised instead. `--forbid-reindexing` option has become default.
- `--reindex` option is removed. Use `dipdup schema wipe` instead.
- Values of `dipdup_schema.reindex` field updated to simplify querying database. See [`dipdup.enums.ReindexingReason`](https://github.com/dipdup-io/dipdup/blob/master/src/dipdup/enums.py) class for possible values.

### Fixed

- Fixed `ReindexRequiredError` not being raised when running DipDup after reindexing was triggered.

- Fixed issue in `BigMapIndex` causing the partial loss of big map diffs.
- Fixed printing help for CLI commands.

### Improved

## [3.0.4] - 2021-10-04

### Improved

- A significant increase in indexing speed.

### Fixed

- Fixed unexpected reindexing caused by the bug in processing zero- and single-level rollbacks.
- Removed unnecessary file IO calls that could cause `PermissionError` exception in Docker environments.
- Fixed possible violation of block-level atomicity during realtime indexing.

### Changes

## [3.0.3] - 2021-10-01

### Fixed

- Fixed processing of single-level rollbacks emitted before rolled back head.

## [3.0.2] - 2021-09-30

### Added

- Human-readable `CHANGELOG.md` ðŸ•º
- Two new options added to `dipdup run` command:
  - `--forbid-reindexing` â€“ raise `ReindexingRequiredError` instead of truncating database when reindexing is triggered for any reason. To continue indexing with existing database run `UPDATE dipdup_schema SET reindex = NULL;`
  - `--postpone-jobs` â€“ job scheduler won't start until all indexes are synchronized. 

### Changed

- Migration to this version requires reindexing.
- `dipdup_index.head_id` foreign key removed. `dipdup_head` table still contains the latest blocks from Websocket received by each datasource.

### Fixed

- Removed unnecessary calls to TzKT API.
- Fixed removal of PostgreSQL extensions (`timescaledb`, `pgcrypto`) by function `truncate_database` triggered on reindex.
- Fixed creation of missing project package on `init`.

- Fixed processing of reorg messages.

## [3.0.1] - 2021-09-24

### Added

- Added `get_quote` and `get_quotes` methods to `TzKTDatasource`.

### Fixed

- Defer spawning index datasources until initial sync is complete. It helps to mitigate some WebSocket-related crashes, but initial sync is a bit slower now.
- Fixed possible race conditions in `TzKTDatasource`.
- Start `jobs` scheduler after all indexes sync with a current head to speed up indexing.
