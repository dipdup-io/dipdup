## 3.0.1 - 2021-09-24

### Added

* Added `get_quote` and `get_quotes` methods to `TzKTDatasource`.

### Fixed

* Defer spawning index datasources until initial sync is complete. It helps to mitigate some WebSocket-related crashes, but initial sync is a bit slower now.

* Start `jobs` scheduler after all indexes sync with a current head to speed up indexing.
