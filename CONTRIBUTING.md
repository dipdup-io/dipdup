# DipDup contribution guide

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

## General

* All code in this repository MUST be licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE).
* Python code in this repository MUST run on Python 3.10. It also SHOULD run on Python 3.11. Using modern language features is encouraged.
* Python code in this repository MUST run in Linux, macOS, Docker, and `amd64`/`arm64` environments. Windows SHOULD be supported as well.
* We use the [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) package manager and GNU Make to set up the development environment. You SHOULD install both tools and run `make help` to see available shortcuts.
* Developers SHOULD have fun while contributing to the project.

## GitHub

* Branch names MUST follow `prefix/short-description` format. Prefixes currently in use: `feat` for features, `fix` for bugfixes, `docs` for documentation, `aux` for miscellaneous, `exp` for experiments.
* Commits in pull requests MUST be squashed when merging to `master`.
* Issues and pull requests MUST have a descriptive title; they SHOULD be linked to each other, appropriately labeled, and assigned to maintainers while in progress.

## Codestyle

* We use the following combo of linters and formatters: `isort`, `black`, `flake8`, `mypy`. All linter checks MUST pass before merging code to `master` (CI will fail otherwise).
* Single quotes are RECOMMENDED for string literals.
* Meaningful comments are highly RECOMMENDED to begin with `# NOTE:`, `# TODO:`, or `# FIXME:`.
* f-string formatting is RECOMMENDED over other methods. Logging is an exception to this rule.

## Releases

* Release versions MUST conform to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Releases that introduce breaking changes MUST be major ones.
* Only the latest major version is supported in general. Critical fixes MAY be backported to the previous major release. To do so, create an `aux/X.Y.Z` branch from the latest stable tag, bump the DipDup version manually, and add a new tag.

## Documentation

* All changes that affect user experience MUST be documented in the CHANGELOG.md file.
* Changes that significantly affect DipDup maintainers' experience MAY be documented in the CHANGELOG.md file.
* The changelog MUST conform to the "Keep a Changelog" specification (CI will break otherwise).
* A page in Release Notes SHOULD accompany all major releases.
* All internal links MUST be created with `{{ #summary ...` shortcodes.
* All values used in project templates MUST be replaced with `{{ #cookiecutter ...` shortcodes.
