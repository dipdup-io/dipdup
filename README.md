DipDup is a Python framework for building smart contract indexers. It helps developers focus on business logic instead of writing a boilerplate to store and serve data. DipDup-based indexers are selective, which means only required data is requested. This approach allows to achieve faster indexing times and decreased load on underlying APIs.

* **Ready to build your first indexer?** Head to [Quickstart](https://docs.dipdup.io/quickstart).
