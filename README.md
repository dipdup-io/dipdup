DipDup is a Python framework for building indexers of [Tezos](https://tezos.com/) smart contracts. It helps developers focus on the business logic instead of writing data storing and serving boilerplate. DipDup-based indexers are selective, which means only required data is requested. This approach allows to achieve faster indexing times and decreased load on APIs DipDup uses.
