# indexes

_Index_ â€” is a basic DipDup entity connecting the inventory and specifying data handling rules.

Each index has a unique string identifier acting as a key under `indexes` config section:

```yaml
indexes:
  my_index:
    kind: operation
    datasource: tzkt_mainnet
```

There can be various index kinds; currently, two possible options are supported for the `kind` field:

* `operation`
* `big_map`

All the indexes have to specify the `datasource` field, an alias of an existing entry under the [datasources](../datasources.md) section.

## Indexing scope

One can optionally specify block levels DipDup has to start and stop indexing at, e.g., there's a new version of the contract, and it will be more efficient to stop handling the old one.

```yaml
indexes:
  my_index:
    first_level: 1000000
    last_level: 2000000
```
