# Quickstart

This page will guide you through the steps to get your first selective indexer up and running in a few minutes without getting too deep into the details.

Let's create an indexer for the [tzBTC FA1.2 token contract](https://tzkt.io/KT1PWx2mnDueood7fEmfbBDKx1D9BAnnXitn/operations/). Our goal is to save all token transfers to the database and then calculate some statistics of its holders' activity.

`demo_token` demo is discussed in this guide; you can find it in the list of available templates when running `dipdup new` command.

A modern Linux/macOS distribution with Python 3.11 installed is required to run DipDup.

## Create a new project

### Interactively (recommended)

You can initialize a hello-world project interactively by choosing configuration options in the terminal. The following command will install DipDup for the current user:

```shell
curl -Lsf https://dipdup.io/install.py | python3.11
```

Now, let's create a new project:

```shell
dipdup new
```

Follow the instructions; the project will be created in the current directory. You can skip reading the rest of this page and slap `dipdup run` instead.

### From scratch

If you don't want to use our installer, you can install DipDup manually. You can use any Python package manager you like, but we recommend [PDM](https://pdm.fming.dev/latest/).


```shell
# Create a new project directory
mkdir {{ project.package }}; cd {{ project.package }}

# PDM
pdm init --python ">=3.11,<3.12"
pdm add dipdup
pdm venv activate

# Plain pip
python -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install dipdup

# or Poetry
poetry init --python ">=3.11,<3.12"
poetry add dipdup
poetry shell
```

## Write a configuration file

DipDup configuration is stored in YAML files of a specific format. Create a new file named `dipdup.yaml` in the project root with the following content:

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
{{ #include ../src/demo_token/dipdup.yaml }}
```

## Generate types and stubs

Now it's time to generate typeclasses and callback stubs. Run the following command:

```shell
dipdup init
```

DipDup will create a Python package `demo_token` having the following structure:

```
demo_token [src/demo_token]
├── abi
├── configs
│   ├── dipdup.compose.yaml
│   ├── dipdup.sqlite.yaml

│   ├── tzbtc/tezos_parameters/transfer.py
│   └── tzbtc/tezos_storage.py
├── py.typed
├── __init__.py
└── pyproject.toml
```

That's a lot of files and directories! But don't worry, we will need only `models` and `handlers` sections in this guide.

## Define data models

Our schema will consist of a single model `Holder` having several fields:

- `address` — account address
- `balance` — in tzBTC
- `volume` — total transfer/mint amount bypassed
- `tx_count` — number of transfers/mints
- `last_seen` — time of the last transfer/mint

Put the following content in the `models/__init__.py` file:

```python [models/__init__.py]
{{ #include ../src/demo_token/models/__init__.py }}
```

## Implement handlers

Everything's ready to implement an actual indexer logic.

Our task is to index all the balance updates, so we'll start with a helper method to handle them. Create a file named `on_balance_update.py` in the `handlers` package with the following content:

```python [handlers/on_balance_update.py]
{{ #include ../src/demo_token/handlers/on_balance_update.py }}
```

Three methods of tzBTC contract can alter token balances — `transfer`, `mint`, and `burn`. The last one is omitted in this tutorial for simplicity. Edit corresponding handlers to call the `on_balance_update` method with data from matched operations:

```python [handlers/on_transfer.py]
{{ #include ../src/demo_token/handlers/on_transfer.py }}
```

```python [handlers/on_mint.py]
{{ #include ../src/demo_token/handlers/on_mint.py }}
```

And that's all! We can run the indexer now.

## Next steps 

Run the indexer in-memory:

```bash
dipdup run
```

Store data in SQLite database:

```bash
dipdup -c . -c configs/dipdup.sqlite.yml run
```

Or spawn a docker-compose stack:

```bash
cp deploy/.env.example .env
# Edit .env before running
docker-compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml up
```

DipDup will fetch all the historical data and then switch to realtime updates. Your application data has been successfully indexed!
