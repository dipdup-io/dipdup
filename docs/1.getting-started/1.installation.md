# Installation

This page covers the installation of DipDup in different environments.

## Host requirements

A *Linux*/*MacOS* environment with *Python 3.11* installed is required to use DipDup. Other UNIX-like systems should work but are not supported officially.

Minimum hardware requirements are *256 MB RAM*, *1 CPU core*, and some disk space for the database. RAM requirements increase with the number of indexes.

### Non-UNIX environments

Windows is not officially supported, but there's a possibility everything will work fine. In case of issues throw us a message and use `WSL`{lang="js"} or `Docker`{lang="js"}.

We aim to improve cross-platform compatibility in future releases ([issue](https://github.com/dipdup-io/dipdup/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3A%22%F0%9F%9A%A2+ci%2Fcd%22+sort%3Aupdated-desc+)).

## Local installation

### Interactively

The following command will install DipDup for the current user:

```shell [Terminal]
curl -Lsf https://dipdup.io/install.py | python
```

This script uses pipx under the hood to install dipdup and datamodel-codegen as CLI tools. Then you can use any package manager of your choice to manage versions of DipDup and other project dependencies.

### Manually

Currently, we mainly use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) for dependency management in DipDup. If you prefer hatch, pdb, piptools or others — use them instead. Below are some snippets to get you started.

**Create a new project directory:**

```shell [Terminal]
mkdir dipdup-indexer; cd dipdup-indexer
```

**Plain pip**

```shell [Terminal]
python -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install dipdup
```

**Or using poetry**

```shell [Terminal]
poetry init --python ">=3.10,<3.11"
poetry add dipdup
poetry shell
```

## Docker
