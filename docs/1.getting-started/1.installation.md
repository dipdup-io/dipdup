# Installation

This page covers the installation of DipDup in different environments.

## Host requirements

A Linux/macOS environment with Python 3.11 installed is required to use DipDup. Other UNIX-like systems should work but are not supported officially. If you use Windows, please use [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) or Docker.

Minimum hardware requirements are 256 MB RAM, 1 CPU core, and some disk space for the database. RAM requirements increase with the number of indexes.

## Local installation

### Interactively

The following command will install DipDup for the current user:

<!-- TODO: Ensure that it deploys and works as intended -->

```shell [Terminal]
curl -Lsf https://dipdup.io/install.py | python
```

This script will install DipDip as CLI application available everywhere in a system. You can use it to spawn a new project from many templates using `dipdup new` command. Then you can use package manager of your choice to manage project dependencies.

### From scratch

If you don't want to use our installer, you can install DipDup manually. You can use any Python package manager you like, but we recommend [PDM](https://pdm.fming.dev/latest/).

First, create a new project directory and enter it:

```shell [Terminal]
mkdir my_indexer; cd my_indexer
```

Then use the snippets below to create a new package and install DipDup in virtual environment.

#### PDM (recommended)

```shell [Terminal]
pdm init --python ">=3.10,<3.11"
pdm add dipdup
pdm venv activate
```

#### Poetry

```shell [Terminal]
poetry init --python ">=3.10,<3.11"
poetry add dipdup
poetry shell
```

#### pip

```shell [Terminal]
python -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install dipdup
```

## Docker

For Docker installation, please refer to the [Docker](../6.deployment/2.docker.md) page.
