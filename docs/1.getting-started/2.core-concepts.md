# Core concepts

Before proceeding to development, let's take a look at basic DipDup concepts. The main terms are highlighted in _italics_ and will be discussed in detail in the following sections.

## Big picture

DipDup is a _Python SDK_ for building custom backends for decentralized applications, or, _indexers_. DipDup indexers are off-chain services that aggregate blockchain data from various sources and store it in a database.

Each indexer consists of a _YAML config_ file and a _Python package_ with models, handlers, and other code. The configuration file describes what contracts to index, what data to extract from them, and where to store the result. Powerful configuration features like templates, environment variables substitution, and merging multiple files allow making your indexer completely declarative. If you're coming from The Graph, the syntax is somewhat similar to Subgraph manifests.

An _index_ is a set of contracts and rules for processing them as a single entity. Your config can contain more than one index, but they are processed in parallel and cannot share data as execution order is not guaranteed.

The Python package contains ORM models, callbacks, typeclasses, scripts and queries. Models describe the domain-specific data structures you want to store in the database. Callbacks implement the business logic, i.e., how to convert blockchain data to your models. Other files in the package are optional and can be used to extend DipDup functionality.

As a result, you get a service responsible for filling the database with indexed data. Then you can use it to build a custom API backend or integrate with existing ones. DipDup provides _Hasura GraphQL Engine_ integration to expose indexed data via REST and GraphQL with zero configuration, but you can use other API engines like PostgREST or develop one in-house.

## Storage layer

DipDup uses PostgreSQL or SQLite as a database backend. All the data is stored in a single database schema created on the first run. Make sure it's used by DipDup exclusively since changes in index configuration or models DipDup trigger _reindexing_, dropping the whole database schema and starting indexing from scratch. You can, however, mark specific tables as immune to preserve them or configure actions to be performed on each reindexing reason.

DipDup does not support database schema migrations, as they introduce complexity and can mess with data consistency. Any change in models or index definitions will trigger reindexing. DipDup stores hashes of the SQL schema and config file, and checks them each time you run indexing.

DipDup applies all updates _atomically_ block by block, ensuring data integrity. If indexing is interrupted, the next time DipDup starts, it will check the database state and continue from the last block processed. The DipDup state is stored in the database per index and can be used by API consumers to determine the current indexer head.

## Handling chain reorgs

Reorg messages signal chain reorganizations, which means some blocks, including all operations, are _rolled back_ in favor of another with higher fitness. It's crucial to handle these messages correctly to avoid accumulating duplicate or invalid data. DipDup processes chain reorgs by restoring a previous database state, but you can implement your rollback logic by editing the `on_index_rollback`{lang="python"} system hook.

FIXME: Tezos stuff

DipDup works with operation groups (explicit operation and all internal ones, a single contract call) and _Big\_map_ updates (lazy hash map structures, [read more](https://tezostaquito.io/docs/maps_bigmaps/)) — until fully-fledged protocol-level events are not implemented in Tezos.

DipDup is tightly coupled with [TzKT API](http://api.tzkt.io/) but can generally use any data provider which implements a particular feature set. TzKT provides REST endpoints and Websocket subscriptions with flexible filters enabling selective indexing and returns "humanified" contract data, which means you don't have to handle raw Michelson expressions.
