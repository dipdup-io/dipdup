# Creating config

Developing a DipDup indexer begins with creating a YAML config file of a specific format. DipDup expect it to be located in the project root and named `dipdup.yaml`. However, you can provide any path with a `-c` CLI option.

## Structure

Config consists of multiple top-level mappings. In the table below they are grouped by sections for convenience, but in the config file, they can be in any order.

- **Header** used to identify the project and the version of the DipDup specification. All other fields in the config are optional.
- **Inventory** specifies contracts that need to be indexed, datasources to fetch data from, and the database to store data in.
- **Indexes** section contains index templates that will be used to index contract data.
- **Hooks** define functions that can be called manually or on schedule.
- **Integrations** are used to configure third-party services.
- **Miscellanous** options affect the behavior of the whole framework.

## Merging multiple files

DipDup allows you to customize the configuration for a specific environment or workflow. It works similarly to docker-compose anchors but only for top-level sections. If you want to override a nested property, you need to recreate a whole top-level section. To merge several DipDup config files, provide the `-c` command-line option multiple times:

```shell [Terminal]
dipdup -c dipdup.yaml -c configs/dipdup.sqlite.yaml run
```

Use `config export` and `config env` commands to check the resulting config used by DipDup.
