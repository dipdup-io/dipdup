# Creating config

Developing a DipDup indexer begins with creating a YAML config file of a specific format. DipDup expect it to be located in the project root and named `dipdup.yaml`. However, you can provide any path with a `-c` CLI option.

## Structure

Config consists of multiple top-level mappings. In the table below they are grouped by sections for convenience, but in the config file, they can be in any order. The only required section is **Header**.

|                  |                                                 |                                                                       |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Header**       | [spec_version](../9.config/14.spec_version.md)* | DipDup project specification; currently "2.0"                         |
|                  | [package](../9.config/11.package.md)*           | Python package name                                                   |
| **Inventory**    | [database](../9.config/4.database.md)           | Database configuration                                                |
|                  | [contracts](../9.config/2.contracts.md)         | Contracts that need to be indexed                                     |
|                  | [datasources](../9.config/5.datasources.md)     | Datasources to gather information from                                |
| **Indexes**      | [indexes](../9.config/8.indexes.md)             | Index definitions                                                     |
|                  | [templates](../9.config/15.templates.md)        | Also index definitions, but with placeholders that make them reusable |
| **Hooks**        | [hooks](../9.config/7.hooks.md)                 | Callbacks to run manually or by schedule                              |
|                  | [jobs](../9.config/9.jobs.md)                   | Schedules for hooks                                                   |
| **Integrations** | [hasura](../9.config/6.hasura.md)               | Hasura GraphQL Engine configuration                                   |
|                  | [sentry](../9.config/13.sentry.md)              | Sentry configuration                                                  |
|                  | [prometheus](../9.config/12.prometheus.md)      | Prometheus configuration                                              |
| **Miscellaneous**| [advanced](../9.config/1.advanced.md)           | Tunables that affect framework behavior                               |
|                  | [custom](../9.config/3.custom.md)               | Mapping of user-defined values; neither typed nor validated           |
|                  | [logging](../9.config/10.logging.md)            | Configure logging verbosity                                           |

## Merging multiple files

DipDup allows you to customize the configuration for a specific environment or workflow. It works similarly to docker-compose anchors but only for top-level sections. If you want to override a nested property, you need to recreate a whole top-level section. To merge several DipDup config files, provide the `-c` command-line option multiple times:

```shell [Terminal]
dipdup -c dipdup.yaml -c configs/dipdup.sqlite.yaml run
```

Use `config export`{lang="sh"} and `config env`{lang="sh"} commands to check the resulting config used by DipDup.

## Environment variables

DipDup supports compose-style variable expansion with an optional default value. Use this feature to store sensitive data outside of the configuration file and make your app fully declarative. If a required variable is not set, DipDup will fail with an error. You can use these placeholders anywhere throughout the configuration file.

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
database:
  kind: postgres
  host: ${POSTGRES_HOST:-localhost}
  password: ${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}
```

There are multiple ways to pass environment variables to DipDup:

- Export them in the shell before running DipDup
- Create the env file and pass it to DipDup with the `-e` CLI option

For every config file in the `deploy` project directory, DipDup will create a corresponding `.env.default` file with all the variables used in the config. Copy it, remove the `.default` suffix and fill in the values.

```sh [deploy/.env.default]
POSTGRES_HOST=localhost
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=
```

You can use `dipdup -e .env config export --unsafe`{lang="sh"} command to ensure that env variables resolve as expected, but avoid sharing the output with third parties.

## Contract typenames

`typename` is an alias for the particular contract script, meaning that two contracts sharing the same code can have the same type name. If this field is not set, a contract alias will be used instead.

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
contracts:
  kusd_dex_mainnet:
    kind: tezos
    address: KT1CiSKXR68qYSxnbzjwvfeMCRburaSDonT2
    typename: quipu_fa12
  tzbtc_dex_mainnet:
    kind: tezos
    address: KT1N1wwNPqT5jGhM91GQ2ae5uY8UzFaXHMJS
    typename: quipu_fa12
```

If multiple contracts you index have the same interface but different code, see [F.A.Q.](../12.faq.md) learn how to avoid conflicts.
