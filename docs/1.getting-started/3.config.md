# Config

Developing a DipDup indexer begins with creating a YAML config file of a specific format. DipDup expects it to be located in the project root and named `dipdup.yaml`. However, you can provide any path with a `-c` CLI option.

## Structure

Config consists of multiple top-level mappings. In the table below they are grouped by sections for convenience, but in the config file, they can be in any order. The only required section is **Header**.

See [Config reference guide](../7.references/2.config.md) for the full list of available options.

|                   |                 |                                                                       |
| ----------------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Header**        | `spec_version`* | DipDup project specification; currently "3.0"                         |
|                   | `package`*      | Python package name                                                   |
| **Inventory**     | `database`      | Database configuration                                                |
|                   | `contracts`     | Contracts that need to be indexed                                     |
|                   | `datasources`   | Datasources to gather information from                                |
| **Indexes**       | `indexes`       | Index definitions                                                     |
|                   | `templates`     | Also index definitions, but with placeholders that make them reusable |
| **Hooks**         | `hooks`         | Callbacks to run manually or by schedule                              |
|                   | `jobs`          | Schedules for hooks                                                   |
| **Integrations**  | `api`           | Internal API configuration                                            |
|                   | `hasura`        | Hasura GraphQL Engine configuration                                   |
|                   | `sentry`        | Sentry configuration                                                  |
|                   | `prometheus`    | Prometheus configuration                                              |
| **Miscellaneous** | `advanced`      | Tunables that affect framework behavior                               |
|                   | `custom`        | Mapping of user-defined values; neither typed nor validated           |
|                   | `logging`       | Configure logging verbosity                                           |

## Merging multiple files

DipDup allows you to customize the configuration for a specific environment or workflow. It works similarly to docker-compose anchors but only for top-level sections. If you want to override a nested property, you need to recreate a whole top-level section. To merge several DipDup config files, provide the `-c` command-line option multiple times:

```shell [Terminal]
dipdup -c dipdup.yaml -c configs/dipdup.sqlite.yaml run
```

Use `config export`{lang="sh"} and `config env`{lang="sh"} commands to check the resulting config used by DipDup.

## Environment variables

_For the list of variables to configure DipDup see [this page](../5.advanced/2.environment-variables.md)._

DipDup supports compose-style variable expansion with an optional default value. Use this feature to store sensitive data outside of the configuration file and make your app fully declarative. If a required variable is not set, DipDup will fail with an error. You can use these placeholders anywhere throughout the configuration file.

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
database:
  kind: postgres
  host: ${POSTGRES_HOST:-localhost}
  password: ${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}
```

There are multiple ways to pass environment variables to DipDup:

- Export them in the shell before running DipDup
- Create the env file and pass it to DipDup with the `-e` CLI option

For every config file in the `deploy` project directory, DipDup will create a corresponding `.env.default` file with all the variables used in the config. Copy it, remove the `.default` suffix and fill in the values.

```sh [deploy/.env.default]
POSTGRES_HOST=localhost
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=
```

You can use `dipdup -e .env config export --unsafe`{lang="sh"} command to ensure that env variables resolve as expected, but avoid sharing the output with third parties.

## Contract typenames

`typename` is an alias for the particular contract script, meaning that two contracts sharing the same code can have the same type name. If this field is not set, a contract alias will be used instead.

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
contracts:
  kusd_dex_mainnet:
    kind: tezos
    address: KT1CiSKXR68qYSxnbzjwvfeMCRburaSDonT2
    typename: quipu_fa12
  tzbtc_dex_mainnet:
    kind: tezos
    address: KT1N1wwNPqT5jGhM91GQ2ae5uY8UzFaXHMJS
    typename: quipu_fa12
```

If multiple contracts you index have the same interface but different code, see [F.A.Q.](../12.faq.md) to learn how to avoid conflicts.

## Reindexing

In some cases, DipDup can't proceed with indexing without a full wipe. Several reasons trigger reindexing:

| reason            | description                                                                                                                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `manual`          | Reindexing triggered manually from callback with `ctx.reindex`.                                                                            |
| `migration`       | Applied migration requires reindexing. Check release notes before switching between major DipDup versions to be prepared.                  |
| `rollback`        | Reorg message received from datasource and can not be processed.                                                                           |
| `config_modified` | One of the index configs has been modified.                                                                                                |
| `schema_modified` | Database schema has been modified. Try to avoid manual schema modifications in favor of [SQL scripts](../1.getting-started/5.database.md). |

It is possible to configure desirable action on reindexing triggered by a specific reason.

| action                | description                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `exception` (default) | Raise `ReindexingRequiredError` and quit with error code. The safest option since you can trigger reindexing accidentally, e.g., by a typo in config. Don't forget to set up the correct restart policy when using it with containers. |
| `wipe`                | Drop the whole database and start indexing from scratch. Be careful with this option!                                                                                                                                                  |
| `ignore`              | Ignore the event and continue indexing as usual. It can lead to unexpected side-effects up to data corruption; make sure you know what you are doing.                                                                                  |

To configure actions for each reason, add the following section to the DipDup config:

```yaml
advanced:
  reindex:
    manual: wipe
    migration: exception
    rollback: ignore
    config_modified: exception
    schema_modified: exception
```

## Advanced options

Flags related to the project are set in the `advanced` section of the config (most likely in `dipdup.yaml`).

| flag                 | description                                                                                                            |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `early_realtime`     | Establish realtime connection and start collecting messages while sync is in progress (faster, but consumes more RAM). |
| `decimal_precision`  | Overwrite precision if it's not guessed correctly based on project models.                                             |
| `postpone_jobs`      | Do not start job scheduler until all indexes reach the realtime state.                                                 |
| `rollback_depth`     | A number of levels to keep for rollback.                                                                               |
| `unsafe_sqlite`      | Disable journaling and data integrity checks. Use only for testing.                                                    |
