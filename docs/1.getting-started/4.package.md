# Project package

Each DipDup project consists of a YAML config and a Python package of a specific structure. It could be placed anywhere, but needs to be importable. The package name is defined in the config file.

To generate all necessary directories and files according to config run the `init` command. You should run it every time you significantly change the config file.

The structure of the resulting package is the following:

| Path                          | Description                                                                                                                          |

Also, there are `.dockerignore`, `.gitignore` files and `py.typed` marker ([PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)). Usually, you won't need to modify them.

## ABIs and typeclasses

DipDup uses contract type information to generate [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/) models to work with strictly typed data. We call these models _typeclasses_. Modules in the `types` directory are generated automatically from contract ABIs and JSONSchemas during init. You can modify them manually, but usually won't need to. Under the hood, the process is roughly the following:

1. Contract ABIs are fetched from public sources or provided by the user.
2. DipDup converts these ABIs to intermediate JSONSchemas.
3. JSONSchemas converted to Pydantic models with [datamodel-code-generator](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/datamodel_code_generator/).

This approach allows working with complex contract types with nested structures and polymorphic variants.

## Nested packages

Callbacks can be grouped into packages to organize the project structure. Add one or multiple dots to the callback name to define nested packages:

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
package: {{ project.package }}
hooks:
  backup.restore:
    callback: backup.on_restore
```

After running the `init` command, you'll get the following directory tree (shortened for brevity)

```text
{{ project.package }}
├── hooks
│   ├── backup
│   │   └── on_restore.py
└── sql
    └── backup
        └── on_restore
```

Handler callbacks can be grouped the same way. Note, that the callback name still needs to be a valid Python module path: _only lowercase letters, underscores, and dots_.
