# Package structure

Each DipDup project consists of a YAML config and a Python package of a specific structure. It could be placed anywhere, but needs to be importable. The package name is defined in the config file.

To generate all necessary directories and files according to config run the `init` command. You should run it every time you significantly change the config file.

The structure of the resulting package is the following:

| Path                     | Description                                                     |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| :file_folder: `abi`      | Contract ABIs used to generate typeclasses                      |
| :file_folder: `configs`  | Environment-specific configs to merge with the root one         |
| :file_folder: `deploy`   | Dockerfiles, compose files, and default variables               |
| :file_folder: `graphql`  | Custom GraphQL queries for Hasura                               |
| :file_folder: `handlers` | User-defined callbacks to process contract data                 |
| :file_folder: `hasura`   | Arbitrary Hasura metadata to apply during configuration         |
| :file_folder: `hooks`    | User-defined callbacks to run manually or by schedule           |
| :file_folder: `models`   | DipDup ORM models to store data in the database                 |
| :file_folder: `sql`      | SQL scripts and queries to run manually or on specific events   |
| :file_folder: `types`    | Automatically generated Pydantic dataclasses for contract types |

There's also a bunch on files in the root directory: .ignore files, pyproject.toml, PEP 561 marker, etc. Usually, you won't need to modify them.

## ABIs and typeclasses

DipDup uses contract type information to generate dataclasses for developers to work with strictly typed data. These dataclasses are generated automatically from contract ABIs. In most cases, you don't need to modify them manually. The process is roughly the following:

1. Contract ABIs are placed in the `abi` directory; either manually or during init.
2. DipDup converts these ABIs to intermediate JSONSchemas.
3. JSONSchemas converted to Pydantic dataclasses.

This approach allows to work with complex contract types with nested structures and polymorphic variants.

<!--
DipDup receives all smart contract data (transaction parameters, resulting storage, big_map updates) in normalized form ([read more](https://baking-bad.org/blog/2021/03/03/tzkt-v14-released-with-improved-smart-contract-data-and-websocket-api/) about how TzKT handles Michelson expressions) but still as raw JSON. DipDup uses contract type information to generate data classes, which allow developers to work with strictly typed data.

DipDup generates [Pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/datamodel_code_generator/) models out of JSONSchema. You might want to install additional plugins ([PyCharm](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/pycharm_plugin/), [mypy](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/mypy_plugin/)) for convenient work with this library.

The following models are created at `init` for different indexes:

* `operation`: storage type for all contracts in handler patterns plus parameter type for all destination+entrypoint pairs.
* `big_map`: key and storage types for all used contracts and big map paths.
* `event`: payload types for all used contracts and tags.

Other index kinds do not use code generated types.

## Nested packages

Callbacks can be joined into packages to organize the project structure. Add one or multiple dots to the callback name to define nested packages:

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
package: indexer
hooks:
  foo.bar:
    callback: foo.bar
```

After running the `init` command, you'll get the following directory tree:

<!-- TODO: Borked tree -->

```
indexer
├── hooks
│   ├── foo
│   │   └── bar.py
└── sql
    └── foo
        └── bar
```

The same applies to handler callbacks. The callback alias still needs to be a valid Python module path: lowercase letters, underscores, and dots.
