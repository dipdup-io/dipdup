# Database

## Database engines

DipDup officially supports SQLite, PostgreSQL and TimescaleDB as a database engine. This table will help you choose a database engine that mostly suits your needs.

|                      | SQLite            | PostgreSQL    | TimescaleDB             |
|:-------------------- |:----------------- |:------------- |:----------------------- |
| Recommended versions | latest            | 14, 15        | 14, 15                  |
| Best application     | early development | general usage | working with timeseries |
| SQL scripts          | 🟢                | 🟢            | 🟢                      |
| Immune tables        | ⚠️                | 🟢            | 🟢                      |
| Hasura integration   | 🔴                | 🟢            | 🟢                      |
| Migrations           | 🔴                | 🟢            | 🟢                      |

By default, DipDup uses an in-memory SQLite database that is destroyed after the process exits.

::banner{type="warning"}
Immune tables support for SQLite is experimental and requires `advanced.unsafe_sqlite` flag set. Use this feature only for early experiments with database structure, and switch to PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB later.
::

The latest PostgreSQL and TimescaleDB versions are recommended due to significant performance improvements in recent releases (see [Feature matrix](https://www.postgresql.org/about/featurematrix/) page).

Usually, it's okay to use different database engines for development and production, but be careful with SQL scripts and column types that can behave differently.

## Internal tables

Several tables having `dipdup_` prefix are created by DipDup automatically and are not intended to be modified by the user. However, they can be useful for external monitoring and debugging.

| table                      | description                                                                                                                               |
|:-------------------------- |:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dipdup_schema`            | Information about database schema in use including hash to detect changes that require reindexing.                                        |
| `dipdup_head`              | The latest block received by index datasources in realtime state. Indicates that underlying datasource is ok.                             |
| `dipdup_index`             | Everything about specific indexes from config: status, current level, template and its values if applicable.                              |
| `dipdup_contract`          | Info about contracts used by all indexes, including ones added in runtime.                                                                |
| `dipdup_model_update`      | Service table to store model diffs for database rollback. Configured by `advanced.rollback_depth`                                         |
| `dipdup_meta`              | Arbitrary key-value storage for DipDup internal use. Survives reindexing. You can use it too, but don't touch keys with `dipdup_` prefix. |
| `dipdup_contract_metadata` | See [Metadata interface](../5.advanced/11.metadata-interface.md).                                                                      |
| `dipdup_token_metadata`    | See [Metadata interface](../5.advanced/11.metadata-interface.md)                                                                           |

See [`dipdup.models` module](https://github.com/dipdup-io/dipdup/blob/next/src/dipdup/models/__init__.py) for exact table definitions.

If you want to use these tables in monitoring, here are some SQL snippets to help you get started:

```sql
-- Time since last block received by index datasources
SELECT name, NOW() - timestamp FROM dipdup_head;

-- Index statuses
SELECT name, status FROM dipdup_index;

-- Get last reindex time
SELECT created_at FROM dipdup_schema WHERE name = 'public';
```

## SQL scripts

Put your `*.sql` scripts to `{{ project.package }}/sql`. You can run these scripts from any callback with `ctx.execute_sql_script('name')`. If `name` is a directory, each script it contains will be executed.

Scripts are executed without being wrapped with SQL transactions. It's generally a good idea to avoid touching table data in scripts.

By default, an empty `sql/<hook_name>` directory is generated for every hook in config during init. Remove `ctx.execute_sql` call from hook callback to avoid executing them.

```python
# Execute all scripts in sql/my_hook directory
await ctx.execute_sql_script('my_hook')

# Execute a single script
await ctx.execute_sql_script('my_hook/my_script.sql')
```

## Helper functions

When using PostgreSQL or Timescale as database engine you can use `dipdup_approve` and `dipdup_wipe` functions to manage schema state from SQL console if needed:

```sql
SELECT dipdup_approve('public');

-- WARNING: This action is irreversible! All indexed data will be lost!
SELECT dipdup_wipe('public');
```

Please note that `dipdup_wipe` function doesn't support preserving immune tables.

## Immune tables

You might want to keep several tables during schema wipe if the data in them is not dependent on index states yet heavy. A typical example is indexing IPFS data — changes in your code won't affect off-chain storage, so you can safely reuse this data.

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
database:
  immune_tables:
    - ipfs_assets
```

`immune_tables` is an optional array of table names that will be ignored during schema wipe. Once an immune table is created, DipDup will never touch it again (unless `schema wipe --immune` is called). If you need to change the schema of an immune table, you should perform a migration manually. Check `schema export` output before doing this to ensure the resulting schema is the same as Tortoise ORM would generate.

## TimescaleDB

TimescaleDB is a PostgreSQL extension that provides time-series data management capabilities. You can use it with DipDup as a drop-in replacement for PostgreSQL.

You can choose `timescale/timescaledb` or `timescale/timescaledb-ha` Docker images when initializing DipDup project.

::banner{type="warning"}
Be careful! Unlike other PostgreSQL images `timescale/timescaledb-ha` uses `/home/postgres/pgdata/data` as a persistent volume.
::

Use SQL scripts in `on_reindex` directory to prepare the database. First, create a hypertable replacing the primary key with a composite one:

```sql [sql/on_reindex/00_prepare_db.sql]
{{ #include ../src/demo_evm_uniswap/sql/on_reindex/00_prepare_db.sql }}
```

Now you can create a continuous aggregate on top of the hypertable:

```sql [sql/on_reindex/20_create_ca_quotes_1m.sql]
{{ #include ../src/demo_evm_uniswap/sql/on_reindex/20_create_ca_quotes_1m.sql }}
```

For more information visit the official TimescaleDB documentation:

- [Continuous aggregates](https://docs.timescale.com/use-timescale/latest/continuous-aggregates/)

## Migrations

::banner{type="note"}
The database migrations feature is optional and is disabled by default. To enable it, you need to install `aerich`, which is available in the `[migrations]` optional dependencies group.
::

DipDup supports database migrations with [aerich](https://github.com/tortoise/aerich), a Tortoise ORM migration tool. The migration files are stored in the `migrations` directory in the project root.

DipDup provides a set of commands to manage database migrations:

- `dipdup schema history` to show the migration history.
- `dipdup schema heads` to show the current available heads.
- `dipdup schema migrate` to create a new migration changes file.
- `dipdup schema upgrade` to upgrade the database to the latest or a specified version.
- `dipdup schema downgrade` to downgrade the database to a previous version.

The migrations directory should be initialized before using these commands. You can run `dipdup schema init` or simply run the indexer with `dipdup run`.

These commands invoke `aerich`'s commands under the hood. You can find more information about `aerich` in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/tortoise/aerich).

Note that you won't be able to directly use `aerich` commands in your project, as DipDup uses its own way of configuring it.
