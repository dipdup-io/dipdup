# Models

To store indexed data in the database, you need to define models. Our storage layer is based on [Tortoise ORM](https://tortoise.github.io/index.html). It's fast, flexible, and have a syntax similar to Django ORM. We have extended it with some useful features like copy-on-write rollback mechanism, caching, and more. But before we begin to dive into the details, here's an important note:

Please, don't report DipDup issues to the Tortoise ORM bugtracker! We patch it heavily to better suit our needs, so it's not Tortoise anymore.

We plan to make things official and fork this library under a new name, but it's not ready yet.

## Defining models

Project models should be placed in `models` directory in the project root. By default, `__init__.py` module created when calling `init` command, but you can use any structure you want. Models from nested packages will be discovered automatically.

A typical module looks like this (example from the `demo_domains`)

```python
{{ #include ../src/demo_domains/models/__init__.py }}
```

Some limitations are applied to model names and fields to avoid ambiguity in GraphQL API.

* Table names must be in `snake_case`
* Model fields must be in `snake_case`
* Model fields must differ from table name

## Using in callbacks

Now you can use these models in your callbacks.

```python
tld = await TLD.filter(id='tez').first()
tld.owner = 'tz1deadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeef'
await tld.save()
```

Visit [Tortose ORM docs](https://tortoise.github.io/examples.html) for more examples.

## Managing transactions

<!-- TODO: We manage it for indexes, you can't open another one, for hooks there's `atomic` flag -->
