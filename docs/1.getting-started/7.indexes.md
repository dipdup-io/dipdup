# Indexes

Index is a primary DipDup entity connecting the inventory and data handling rules.

Multiple indexes are available for different workloads. Every index is linked to a specific datasource and provides a set of handlers for different kinds of data. Use this table to choose the right index for the task:

| kind                                                                      | blockchain     | datasource | indexed data                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- | ---------- | --------------------------- |
| [evm.subsquid.events](8.evm_subsquid_events.md)                           | EVM-compatible | Subsquid   | event logs                  |
| [tezos.tzkt.big_maps](2.tezos_tzkt_big_maps.md)                           | Tezos          | TzKT       | big map diffs               |
| [tezos.tzkt.events](3.tezos_tzkt_events.md)                               | Tezos          | TzKT       | events                      |
| [tezos.tzkt.head](4.tezos_tzkt_head.md)                                   | Tezos          | TzKT       | head blocks (realtime only) |
| [tezos.tzkt.operations](5.tezos_tzkt_operations.md)                       | Tezos          | TzKT       | typed operations            |
| [tezos.tzkt.operations_unfiltered](6.tezos_tzkt_operations_unfiltered.md) | Tezos          | TzKT       | untyped operations          |
| [tezos.tzkt.token_transfers](7.tezos_tzkt_token_transfers.md)             | Tezos          | TzKT       | TZIP-12/16 token transfers  |

Indexes can join multiple contracts considered as a single application. Also, contracts can be used by multiple indexes of any kind, but make sure that they are independent of each other and indexed data don't overlap.

Handler is a callback function, called when new data has arrived from the datasource. The handler receives the data item as an argument and can perform any actions, e.g., store data in the database, send a notification, or call an external API.

## Using templates

Index definitions can be templated to reduce the amount of boilerplate code. To create an index from template use the following syntax:

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
templates:
  operation_index_template:
    kind: tezos.tzkt.operations
    datasource: <datasource>
    ...

indexes:
  template_instance:
    template: operation_index_template
    values:
      datasource: tzkt_mainnet
```

You can also spawn indexes from templates in runtime; see [Variables](../1.getting-started/7.env-variables.md) page.

## Indexing scope

One can optionally specify block levels DipDup has to start and stop indexing at, e.g., there's a new version of the contract, and there's no need to track the old one anymore.

```yaml
indexes:
  my_index:
    first_level: 1000000
    last_level: 2000000
```


## Index templates

Templates allow you to reuse index configuration, e.g., for different networks (mainnet/ghostnet) or multiple contracts sharing the same codebase.

```yaml
templates:
  my_template:
    kind: tezos.tzkt.operations
    datasource: <datasource>
    contracts:
      - <contract>
    handlers:
      - callback: callback
        pattern:
          - destination: <contract>
            entrypoint: call
```

Templates have the same syntax as indexes of all kinds; the only difference is that they additionally support placeholders enabling parameterization:

```yaml
field: <placeholder>
```

The template above can be resolved in the following way:

```yaml
contracts:
  some_dex: ...

datasources:
  tzkt: ...

indexes:
  my_template_instance:
    template: my_template
    values:
      datasource: tzkt_mainnet
      contract: some_dex
```

Any string value wrapped in angle brackets is treated as a placeholder, so make sure there are no collisions with the actual values. You can use a single placeholder multiple times. In contradiction to environment variables, dictionary keys cannot be placeholders.

An index created from a template must have a value for each placeholder; the exception is raised otherwise. These values are available in the handler context as `ctx.template_values` dictionary.

You can also spawn indexes from templates in runtime. To achieve the same effect as above, you can use the following code:

```python
ctx.add_index(
    name='my_template_instance',
    template='my_template',
    values={
        'datasource': 'tzkt_mainnet',
        'contract': 'some_dex',
    },
)
```
