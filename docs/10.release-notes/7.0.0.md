# 7.0.0 Pre-release 1

_(WIP, don't read it lmao)_

Cheers, developers! Do you keep your head warm and your feet dry this crypto winter? You'd better do, cause the next season is gonna be awesome, and it would be a pity to miss smart-contracts blossom laying in bed with a cold. Ok, enough silly jokes. 7.0 release is finally ready enough for the first beta. After half a year of active development, the amount of new features is HUGE, but we hope that updated docs and lots of examples won't let you get lost. If you're updating from 6.5, keep an eye on "Migration" sections on this page.

Key highlights for this release:

- Support for EVM-compatible blockchains.
- Updated, simplier package structure.
- Powerful tools for monitoring and performance tuning.
- Flexible deployment recipes for any environment.
- More datasources, indexes and helpers.

## Development Focus

### EVM support

Now DipDup can index EVM-compatible blockchains receiving data from [subsquid](https://www.subsquid.io/), ABIs from [etherscan](https://etherscan.io/), and some data directly from RPC nodes. There are multiple demo projects available as examples - you can create them using `dipdup new`
<!-- NOTE:
- what are EVM, Subsquid Archives, RPC nodes
- bootstrapping EVM demo
- `abi.etherscan` datasource, manual
- node datasources, configuration
- event matching rules -->

### Performance

DipDup becoming faster with this release:

- Updated project for Python 3.11
- Introduced HTTP pre-fetching
- We have optimized our approach to database interaction, which we refer to as [DipDup ORM](../1.getting-started/5.models.md?DipDup-ORM). Reimplementation of models and fields, enhance the efficiency and performance of DipDup across various databases. While our optimizations have a performance-oriented foundation in PostgreSQL, we have also improved the overall workflow with SQLite.

### Environment, scaffolding and deployment

- [Project package(docs link)](../1.getting-started/4.package.md) was significantly refactored, simplified, and prettified, notable changes are rewritten readme, consistent structure, separate deployments, and configs, rewritten ignore files for docker and git, `dipdup package tree` to debug python package
- Deploy folder with production-ready deployments, files were refactored and renamed to be more understandable and customizable
- Docker images were cleared, excess images removed, and software versions updated
- DipDup handles crash reports, you can easily read and manage them by `dipdup report`
- Logging is now fully customizable from config see [doc](../9.config/10.l-ogging.md)
- Command line interface got a list of small improvements to be more intuitive and correct

### Miscellaneous
- Multiple renames in config, cli, and code to avoid ambiguity

## Migration from 6.5

### Config

- put root config inside
- `spec_version` to 2.0, package in snake_case
- rename contract kinds
- rename datasource kinds
- rename index kinds
- (a huge substitution table)
- remove `advanced.crash_reporting` Remove `advanced.crash_reporting` from your config if presented. Spin up your own.
- remove `advanced.metadata_interface`
- migrate alpine and pytezos images, see how to expand image in docs

### Package

- models to package
- update imports
- update ctx calls

### Final steps

- run dipdup init --force
- run dipdup schema wipe
