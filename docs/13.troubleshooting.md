# Troubleshooting

This page contains tips for troubleshooting DipDup issues. Start with "General" section and then proceed to one that matches your problem.

## General

### Update DipDup to the latest version

If you experience an issue, first of all, make sure that you're using the latest version of DipDup. If a new release is available you'll see a warning message when running DipDup. You can update DipDup using the following commands depending on your installation method:

```shell [Terminal]
# Built-in installer
dipdup self update

# pipx
pipx upgrade dipdup

# PDM
pdm update

# Poetry
poetry update

# pip
pip install --upgrade dipdup
```

When using Docker images you can use `X` and `X.Y` tags to lock to specific major/minor releases:

```docker [Dockerfile]
FROM dipdup/dipdup:{{ project.dipdup_version }}
```

We follow semantic versioning, so you can safely update to a new patch version without any breaking changes.

### Enable debug logging

More logs can give you a clue about the reason for an issue. Enable them in config:

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
logging: DEBUG
```

## Installation

## Config

### Ensure that config is correct

DipDup config can be correct syntactically but not necessarily semantically. It's especially easy to make a mistake when actively using templates and environment variables. Use `config export` command to dump config the way DipDup "sees" it, after resolving all links and templates.

```shell [Terminal]
dipdup -c . -c configs/dipdup.sqlite.yaml config export
```

### Check env variables

`config env` command can help you to find missing environment variables.

```shell [Terminal]
dipdup -c . -c configs/dipdup.sqlite.yaml config env
```

<!-- Careful with compose. Throw inside. -->

## Package

### Use linters to find errors in your Python code

Exceptions that occurred during callback execution are reraised as `CallbackError`s. If you experience this issue, most likely your code is incorrect. Luckily, the Python ecosystem has lots of tools called linters to help you find mistakes. Default DipDup project template includes black, ruff and mypy to check your code for errors and type mismatches. You can run them with the following commands:

```shell [Terminal]
# PDM
pdm format
pdm lint

# Manually
black .
ruff --fix .
mypy .
```

See the `pyproject.toml` file in your project root for more details.

### Inspect the package structure

## Blockchains

### Tezos: explorers

[Better Call Dev](https://better-call.dev) is a blockchain explorer for Tezos smart contracts. It provides a more human-friendly interface than TzKT to explore exact contract calls and parameter/storage structures.

## Found a bug?

When an exception occurs DipDup saves crash dumps to `~/local/share/dipdup/reports`. You can inspect them using `dipdup report ls` and `dipdup report show` commands.

If you think you've found a bug, please report it directly to the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/dipdup-io/dipdup). For all other discussions.
