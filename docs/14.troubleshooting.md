# Troubleshooting

This page contains tips for troubleshooting DipDup issues.

## Update DipDup to the latest version

DipDup framework evolves rapidly just like Tezos itself does. We recommend keeping your project up-to-date with the latest version of DipDup.

If you're using Poetry, set caret version constraint in `pyproject.toml` to use the latest release of the current major version:

```toml
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = ">=3.11,<3.12"
dipdup = "^{{ project.dipdup_version }}"
```

pipx installations always use latest version.

Run `dipdup update` periodically to update to the latest version.

While building Docker images you can use `X` and `X.Y` tags to lock to specific major/minor releases:

```docker
FROM dipdup/dipdup:{{ project.dipdup_version }}
```

## Ensure that config is correct

DipDup config can be correct syntactically but not necessarily semantically. It's especially easy to make a mistake when actively using templates and environment variables. Use `config export` command to dump config the way DipDup "sees" it, after resolving all links and templates. `config env` command can help you to find missing environment variables.

```shell
dipdup -c dipdup.yaml -c dipdup.prod.yaml config export
dipdup -c dipdup.yaml -c dipdup.prod.yaml config env
```

## Enable debug logging and crash reporting

More logs can give you a clue about the reason for an issue. Enable them in config:

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
logging: DEBUG
```

When an exception occurs DipDup saves crash dumps to  `~/local/share/dipdup/crashdumps`. You can inspect them using `dipdup report` and `dipdup report show` commands.

## Use linters to find errors in your Python code

Exceptions that occurred during callback execution are reraised as `CallbackError`s. If you experience this issue, most likely your code is incorrect. Luckily, the Python ecosystem has lots of tools called linters to help you find mistakes. In DipDup we mostly use a combo of `flake8` and `mypy`. You can start using both with zero configuration:

```shell
poetry add --with dev flake8 mypy
poetry run flake8
poetry run mypy
```

You can find a more complex example in DipDup's [pyproject.toml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dipdup-io/dipdup/next/pyproject.toml) or use the cookiecutter template to create a new project with all recommended bells and whistles (see [quickstart anchor from template](../10.move-us/4.quickstart.md?from-template)).

## Explore contract calls in Better Call Dev

[Better Call Dev](https://better-call.dev) is a blockchain explorer for Tezos smart contracts. It provides a more human-friendly interface than TzKT to explore exact contract calls and parameter/storage structures.

## Packaging issues

Poetry package manager we recommend using with DipDup is not the most stable software in the world. If you experience issues with it like `SolverProblemError`, try the following:

* Remove `.venv` and `poetry.lock` from the project root
* Remove `~/.cache/pypoetry` and `~/.cache/pip/` directories
* Run `poetry install` and hope for the best.
