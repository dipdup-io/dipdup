# `evm.subsquid.events` index

This index allows indexing events emitted by Ethereum smart contracts. You can define a handler for each contract/tag pair. Only necessary events are processed.

RPC node is optional for this index. If not specified, the index will lack real-time data and will be able to process only historical data provided by Subsquid Archives API.

This is a basic config for USDt token contract. You can use this demo as a template for your project choosing `demo_evm_events` in `dipdup new` command.

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
{{ #include ../src/demo_evm_events/dipdup.yaml }}
```

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
{{ #include ../src/demo_evm_events/dipdup.yaml:23:32 }}
