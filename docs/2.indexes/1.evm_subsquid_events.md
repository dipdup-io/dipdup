# `evm.subsquid.events` index

This index allows processing events emitted by Ethereum smart contracts. You can define a handler for each contract/tag pair. Only necessary events are processed.

Below is a basic indexer for USDt token contract transfers.

To create a project based on this template, run `dipdup new -t demo_evm_events`.

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
{{ #include ../src/demo_evm_events/dipdup.yaml }}
```

{{ #include 2.indexes/_evm_subsquid.md }}
