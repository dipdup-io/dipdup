# `evm.subsquid.transactions` index

This index allows indexing EVM transactions. You can filter them by `from`, `to` and `method` fields.

RPC node is optional for this index. If not specified, the index will lack real-time data and will be able to process only historical data provided by Subsquid Archives API.

This is a basic config for USDt token contract. You can use this demo as a template for your project choosing `demo_evm_transactions` in `dipdup new` command.

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
{{ #include ../src/demo_evm_transactions/dipdup.yaml }}
```
