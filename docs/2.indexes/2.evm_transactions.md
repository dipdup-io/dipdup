# `evm.transactions` index

<!-- markdownlint-disable no-inline-html -->

{{ #include 3.datasources/_evm_banner.md }}

This index allows indexing EVM transactions and matching them with handlers by content. You can define handlers for multiple sets of filters. Only necessary transactions are processed.

Below is a basic indexer for USDt token contract transfers.

To create a project based on this template, run `dipdup new -t demo_evm_transactions`.

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
{{ #include ../src/demo_evm_transactions/dipdup.yaml }}
```

## Filters

Transactions can be filtered by one or more of the following fields:

| name           | description             | supported | typed |
| -------------- | ----------------------- |:---------:|:-----:|
| `from.address` | Sender address          |     游릭    |   游댮  |
| `to.address`   | Destination address     |     游릭    |  游릭췇  |
| `method`       | Invoked contract method |     游릭    |  游릭췇  |

<sup>췇 both contract address and method need to be specified</sup>

## Typed and untyped arguments

You will get slightly different callback argument types depending on whether the pattern item is typed or not. If both "to" and "method" filters are specified, DipDup will generate a typeclass for particular input from contract ABI. Otherwise, you will have to handle untyped input data stored in `EvmTransactionData` and `EvmTransactionData` models.
