# `starknet.events` index

This index allows processing events emitted by Starknet smart contracts. You can define a handler for each contract/name pair. Only necessary events are processed.

Below is a basic indexer for USDt token contract transfers.

To create a project based on this template, run `dipdup new -t demo_starknet_events`.

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
{{ #include ../src/demo_starknet_events/dipdup.yaml }}
```

{{ #include 2.indexes/_starknet.md }}
