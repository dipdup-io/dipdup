# `tezos.events` index

Kathmandu Tezos protocol upgrade has introduced [contract events](https://tezos.gitlab.io/alpha/event.html), a new way to interact with smart contracts. This index allows indexing events using strictly typed payloads. From the developer's perspective, it's similar to the `tezos.big_maps` index with a few differences.

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
{{ #include ../src/demo_tezos_events/dipdup.yaml }}
```

Unlike big maps, contracts may introduce new event tags and payloads at any time, so the index must be updated accordingly.

```python [handlers/on_move_event.py]
{{ #include ../src/demo_tezos_events/handlers/on_move_event.py }}
```

Each contract can have a fallback handler called for all unknown events so you can process untyped data.

```python [handlers/on_other_event.py]
{{ #include ../src/demo_tezos_events/handlers/on_other_event.py }}
```
