# `tezos.tzkt.operations_unfiltered` index

This index allows indexing all operations of the Tezos blockchain. It's a low-level index that doesn't parse operation storage/parameter and doesn't filter operations by type. Here's a minimal config example:

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
{{ #include ../src/demo_raw/dipdup.yaml }}
```

Handlers receive `TzktOperationData` model that contains untyped operation data.

```python
{{ #include ../src/demo_raw/handlers/on_operation.py }}
```

To use this demo as a template choose `demo_raw` in `dipdup new` command.
