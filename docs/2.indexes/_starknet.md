## Datasources

DipDup indexes for Starknet use [Subsquid Network](https://docs.subsquid.io/subsquid-network/overview/) as a main source of historical data. Starknet nodes are not required for DipDup to operate, but in future updates, it will be possible to use them to get the latest data (not yet in Subsquid Network) and realtime updates. See [starknet.subsquid](../3.datasources/4.starknet_subsquid.md) page for more info on how to configure the datasource.
