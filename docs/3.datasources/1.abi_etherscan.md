# Etherscan

[Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) is a popular Ethereum blockchain explorer. It provides a public API to fetch ABIs of verified contracts. DipDup can use its API to fetch ABIs for contracts being indexed.

{{ #include 3.datasources/_evm_banner.md }}

To use this datasource, add the following section in config:

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
datasources:
  etherscan:
    kind: abi.etherscan
    url: ${ETHERSCAN_URL:-https://api.etherscan.io/api}
    api_key: ${ETHERSCAN_API_KEY:-''}
```

This datasource will be chosen automatically for all contracts with no ABI available locally (`abi/<typename>/abi.json` path). You can also set it explicitly in `evm.subsquid` index definitions:

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
indexes:
  evm_events:
    kind: evm.subsquid.events
    abi:
    - etherscan
    ...
```

## Authorization

If you have an Etherscan API key, you can set it in config. You may also want to increase the ratelimit according to your subscription plan. Otherwise, you will be limited to 5 requests per second.

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
  etherscan:
    kind: abi.etherscan
    url: ${ETHERSCAN_URL:-https://api.etherscan.io/api}
    api_key: ${ETHERSCAN_API_KEY:-''}
    http:
      ratelimit_period: 1
      ratelimit_rate: 10
```
