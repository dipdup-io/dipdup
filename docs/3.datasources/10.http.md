# Generic HTTP

If you need to perform arbitrary requests to APIs not supported by DipDup, use generic HTTP datasource instead of plain `aiohttp` requests. That way you can use the same features DipDup uses for internal requests: retry with backoff, rate limiting, Prometheus integration etc.

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
datasources:
  my_api:
    kind: http
    url: https://my_api.local/v1
```

Then, in your hook or handler code:

```python
api = ctx.get_http_datasource('my_api')
response = await api.request(
    method='get',
    url='hello',
    params={
      'foo': 'bar',
    },
)
```

All DipDup datasources are inherited from `http`, so you can send arbitrary requests with any datasource. Let's say you want to fetch the protocol of the chain you're currently indexing (`tezos.tzkt` datasource doesn't have a separate method for it):

```python
tzkt = ctx.get_tezos_tzkt_datasource('tzkt_mainnet')
protocol_json = await tzkt.request(
    method='get',
    url='v1/protocols/current',
)
assert protocol_json['hash'] == 'PtHangz2aRngywmSRGGvrcTyMbbdpWdpFKuS4uMWxg2RaH9i1qx'
```

Datasource HTTP connection parameters (ratelimit, retry with backoff, etc.) are applied to every request.
