# EVM node

{{ #include 3.datasources/_evm_banner.md }}

DipDup can connect to any EVM-compatible node via JSON-RPC. It can be used as a "last mile" datasource for EVM indexes (data that is not in Subsquid Network yet) or as a standalone datasource for handlers and hooks.

The example below shows how to connect to Alchemy node for Ethereum mainnet, but you can use any as long as it has all the necessary data (e.g. archive node).

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
datasources:
{{ #include ../src/demo_evm_events/dipdup.yaml:11:15 }}
```

Then, add it to EVM index definitions:

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
{{ #include ../src/demo_evm_events/dipdup.yaml:22: }}
```

## web3 client

[web3.py](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is a popular Python library for interacting with Ethereum nodes. Every node datasource has a `web3` client instance attached to it. You can use it in handlers and hooks to fetch data from the node and perform other actions.

Don't initialize web3 clients manually! It will break the connection pooling, lock the event loop, and kill your dog.

To access the client, use `web3` property of the datasource. The underlying web3 client is asynchronous, so you should use `await` keyword to call its methods.

```python
web3: AsyncWeb3 = ctx.get_evm_node_datasource('evm_node').web3
contract = self.web3.eth.contract(...)
symbol = await contract.functions.symbol().call() 
```

Each datasource has its own web3 client instance, so you can use it safely in parallel. web3 clients respect `http` configuration from the datasource config when making requests.
