# Subsquid Network

DipDup uses [Subsquid Network](https://docs.subsquid.io/subsquid-network/reference/evm-api/) as a source of historical data for EVM-compatible blockchains. Configure the datasource in your project config:

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
datasources:
  subsquid:
    kind: evm.subsquid
    url: ${SUBSQUID_URL:-https://v2.archive.subsquid.io/network/ethereum-mainnet}
```

You can also link the datasource to a specific node to allow realtime indexing:

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
datasources:
  evm_node:
    kind: evm.node
    url: ${NODE_URL:-https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2}/${NODE_API_KEY:-''}
    ws_url: ${NODE_WS_URL:-wss://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2}/${NODE_API_KEY:-''}
  subsquid:
    kind: evm.subsquid
    url: ${SUBSQUID_URL:-https://v2.archive.subsquid.io/network/ethereum-mainnet}
```

Now, use this datasource in EVM index definitions:

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
indexes:
  uniswap_v3:
    kind: evm.subsquid.events
    datasource: subsquid
    ...
```
