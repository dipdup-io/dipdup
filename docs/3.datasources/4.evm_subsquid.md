# Subsquid Network

{{ #include 3.datasources/_evm_banner.md }}

DipDup uses [Subsquid Network](https://docs.subsquid.io/subsquid-network/reference/evm-api/) as a source of historical data for EVM-compatible blockchains.

Configure the datasource in your project config:

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
datasources:
  subsquid:
    kind: evm.subsquid
    url: ${SUBSQUID_URL:-https://v2.archive.subsquid.io/network/ethereum-mainnet}
```

You can also set `node` field to one or more `evm.node` datasources to allow realtime indexing:

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
{{ #include ../src/demo_evm_logs/dipdup.yaml:3:16 }}
```

Now, use this datasource in EVM index definitions:

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
{{ #include ../src/demo_evm_logs/dipdup.yaml:23: }}
```
