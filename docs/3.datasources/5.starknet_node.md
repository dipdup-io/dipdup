# Starknet node

DipDup can connect to Starknet nodes via JSON-RPC. It can be used as a last mile datasource for Starknet indexes (data that is not in Subsquid Network yet) or as a standalone datasource for handlers and hooks.

The example below shows how to connect to Alchemy node for Starknet mainnet, but you can use any as long as it has all the necessary data.

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
datasources:
{{ #include ../src/demo_starknet_events/dipdup.yaml:7:10 }}
```

Then, add it to Starknet index definitions:

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
{{ #include ../src/demo_starknet_events/dipdup.yaml:17: }}
```
