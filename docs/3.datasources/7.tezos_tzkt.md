# TzKT

[TzKT](https://api.tzkt.io/) provides REST endpoints to query historical data for Tezos blockchain. Flexible filters allow to request only data needed for your application and drastically speed up the indexing process.

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
datasources:
  tzkt_mainnet:
    kind: tezos.tzkt
    url: https://api.tzkt.io
```

Then, use it in your index definitions:

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
indexes:
  operations:
    kind: tezos.operations
    datasources:
      - tzkt_mainnet
    ...
```

## Message buffer

Also, you can wait for several block confirmations before processing the data:

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
datasources:
  tzkt_mainnet:
    ...
    buffer_size: 1  # indexing with a single block lag
```

Since 6.0 chain reorgs are processed automatically, but you may find this feature useful for other cases.
