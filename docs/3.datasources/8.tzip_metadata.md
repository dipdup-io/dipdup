[dipdup-metadata](https://github.com/dipdup-io/metadata) is a standalone companion indexer for DipDup written in Go. Configure datasource in the following way:

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
datasources:
  metadata:
    kind: tzip_metadata
    url: https://metadata.dipdup.net
    network: mainnet
```

Then, in your hook or handler code:

```python
datasource = ctx.get_metadata_datasource('metadata')
token_metadata = await datasource.get_token_metadata('KT1...', '0')
```
