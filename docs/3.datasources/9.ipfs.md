# IPFS

While working with contract/token metadata, a typical scenario is to fetch it from IPFS. DipDup has a separate datasource to perform such requests via public nodes.

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
datasources:
  ipfs:
    kind: ipfs
    url: https://ipfs.io/ipfs
```

You can use this datasource within any callback. Output is either JSON or binary data.

```python
ipfs = ctx.get_ipfs_datasource('ipfs')

file = await ipfs.get('QmdCz7XGkBtd5DFmpDPDN3KFRmpkQHJsDgGiG16cgVbUYu')
assert file[:4].decode()[1:] == 'PDF'

file = await ipfs.get('QmSgSC7geYH3Ae4SpUHy4KutxqNH9ESKBGXoCN4JQdbtEz/package.json')
assert file['name'] == 'json-buffer'
```
