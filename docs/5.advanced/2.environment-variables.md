# Environment variables

Feature flags allow users to modify parameters that affect the behavior of the whole framework. Choosing the right combination of flags for an indexer project can improve performance, reduce RAM consumption, or enable useful features.

DipDup uses multiple environment variables internally. They read once on process start and usually do not change during runtime.

You can also access these values as `dipdup.env` module attributes.
