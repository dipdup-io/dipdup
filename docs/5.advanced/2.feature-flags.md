# Feature flags

Feature flags allow users to modify parameters that affect the behavior of the whole framework. Choosing the right combination of flags for an indexer project can improve performance, reduce RAM consumption, or enable useful features.

## Project config

Flags related to the project are set in the `advanced` section of the config (most likely in `dipdup.yaml`).

| flag                 | description                                                                                                            |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `early_realtime`     | Establish realtime connection and start collecting messages while sync is in progress (faster, but consumes more RAM). |
| `decimal_precision`  | Overwrite precision if it's not guessed correctly based on project models.                                             |
| `postpone_jobs`      | Do not start job scheduler until all indexes reach the realtime state.                                                 |
| `skip_version_check` | Disable warning about running unstable or out-of-date DipDup version.                                                  |
| `rollback_depth`     | A number of levels to keep for rollback.                                                                               |
| `unsafe_sqlite`      | Disable journaling and data integrity checks. Use only for testing.                                                    |

## Environment variables

DipDup uses multiple environment variables internally. They read once on process start and usually do not change during runtime. You can access them in the `dipdup.env` module to perform additional checks or modify the behavior of your project.

| env variable              | module path                   | description                                                                          |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `DIPDUP_CI`               | `dipdup.env.CI`               | Running in GitHub Actions                                                            |
| `DIPDUP_DEBUG`            | `dipdup.env.DEBUG`            | Enable debug logging and additional checks                                           |
| `DIPDUP_DOCKER`           | `dipdup.env.DOCKER`           | Running in Docker                                                                    |
| `DIPDUP_NEXT`             | `dipdup.env.NEXT`             | Enable experimental features from the next major release that require schema changes |
| `DIPDUP_NO_VERSION_CHECK` | `dipdup.env.NO_VERSION_CHECK` | Disable warning about running unstable or out-of-date DipDup version                 |
| `DIPDUP_NO_SYMLINK`       | `dipdup.env.NO_SYMLINK`       | Don't create magic symlink in the package root even when used as cwd                 |
| `DIPDUP_PACKAGE_PATH`     | `dipdup.env.PACKAGE_PATH`     | Disable package discovery and use the specified path                                 |
| `DIPDUP_REPLAY_PATH`      | `dipdup.env.REPLAY_PATH`      | Path to datasource replay files; used in tests                                       |
| `DIPDUP_TEST`             | `dipdup.env.TEST`             | Running in pytest                                                                    |
