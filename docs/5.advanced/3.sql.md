# Advanced SQL

## Internal tables

Several tables having `dipdup_` prefix are created by DipDup automatically and are not intended to be modified by the user. However, they can be useful for external monitoring and debugging.

| table                      | description                                                                                                                               |
|:-------------------------- |:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dipdup_schema`            | Information about database schema in use including hash to detect changes that require reindexing.                                        |
| `dipdup_head`              | The latest block received by index datasources in realtime state. Indicates that underlying datasource is ok.                             |
| `dipdup_index`             | Everything about specific indexes from config: status, current level, template and its values if applicable.                              |
| `dipdup_contract`          | Info about contracts used by all indexes, including ones added in runtime.                                                                |
| `dipdup_model_update`      | Service table to store model diffs for database rollback. Configured by `advanced.rollback_depth`                                         |
| `dipdup_meta`              | Arbitrary key-value storage for DipDup internal use. Survives reindexing. You can use it too, but don't touch keys with `dipdup_` prefix. |
| `dipdup_contract_metadata` | See [Metadata interface](4.metadata-interface.md)                                                                               |
| `dipdup_token_metadata`    | See [Metadata interface](4.metadata-interface.md)                                                                               |

See [`dipdup.models` module](https://github.com/dipdup-io/dipdup/blob/next/src/dipdup/models/__init__.py) for exact table definitions.

If you want to use these tables in monitoring, here are some SQL snippets to help you get started:

```sql
-- Time since last block received by index datasources
SELECT name, NOW() - timestamp FROM dipdup_head;

-- Index statuses
SELECT name, status FROM dipdup_index;

-- Get last reindex time
SELECT created_at FROM dipdup_schema WHERE name = 'public';
```

## Scripts

Put your `*.sql` scripts to `{{ project.package }}/sql`. You can run these scripts from any callback with `ctx.execute_sql('name')`. If `name` is a directory, each script it contains will be executed.

Scripts are executed without being wrapped with SQL transactions. It's generally a good idea to avoid touching table data in scripts.

By default, an empty `sql/<hook_name>` directory is generated for every hook in config during init. Remove `ctx.execute_sql` call from hook callback to avoid executing them.

```python
# Execute all scripts in sql/my_hook directory
await ctx.execute_sql('my_hook')

# Execute a single script
await ctx.execute_sql('my_hook/my_script.sql')
```

## Managing schema

When using PostgreSQL or Timescale as database engine you can use `dipdup_approve` and `dipdup_wipe` functions to manage schema state from SQL console if needed:

```sql
SELECT dipdup_approve('public');

-- WARNING: This action is irreversible! All indexed data will be lost!
SELECT dipdup_wipe('public');
```

Please note that `dipdup_wipe` function doesn't support preserving immune tables.
