# SQL scripts

Put your `*.sql` scripts to `{{ project.package }}/sql`. You can run these scripts from any callback with `ctx.execute_sql('name')`. If `name` is a directory, each script it contains will be executed.

Scripts are executed without being wrapped with SQL transactions. It's generally a good idea to avoid touching table data in scripts.

By default, an empty `sql/<hook_name>` directory is generated for every hook in config during init. Remove `ctx.execute_sql` call from hook callback to avoid executing them.
