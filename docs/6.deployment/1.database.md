# Database engines

DipDup officially supports SQLite, PostgreSQL and TimescaleDB as a database engine. This table will help you choose a database engine that mostly suits your needs.

|                      |       SQLite      |   PostgreSQL  |       TimescaleDB       |
|:-------------------- |:-----------------:|:-------------:|:-----------------------:|
| Recommended versions |       latest      |     14, 15    |          14, 15         |
| Best application     | early development | general usage | working with timeseries |
| SQL scripts          |         ✅         |       ✅       |            ✅            |
| Immune tables        |         ⚠         |       ✅       |            ✅            |
| Hasura integration   |         ❌         |       ✅       |            ✅            |

By default DipDup uses in-memory SQLite database that destroys after the process exits.

::banner{type="warning"}
Immune tables support for SQLite is experimental and requires `advanced.unsafe_sqlite` flag set. Use this feature only for early experiments with database structure, and switch to PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB later.
::

Latest PostgreSQL and TimescaleDB versions are recommended due to significant performance improvements in recent releases (see [Feature matrix](https://www.postgresql.org/about/featurematrix/) page).

Usually it's okay to use different database engines for development and production, but be careful with SQL scripts and column types that can behave differently.

## TimescaleDB

TimescaleDB is a PostgreSQL extension that provides time-series data management capabilities. You can use it with DipDup as a drop-in replacement for PostgreSQL.

You can choose `timescale/timescaledb` or `timescale/timescaledb-ha` Docker images when initializing DipDup project.

::banner{type="warning"}
Be careful! Unlike other PostgreSQL images `timescale/timescaledb-ha` uses `/home/postgres/pgdata/data` as a persistent volume.
::

Use SQL scripts in `on_reindex` directory to prepare the database. First, create a hypertable replacing primary key with composite one:

```sql [sql/on_reindex/00_prepare_db.sql]
{{ #include ../src/demo_uniswap/sql/on_reindex/00_prepare_db.sql }}
```

Now you can create a continuous aggregate on top of the hypertable:

```sql [sql/on_reindex/20_create_ca_quotes_1m.sql]
{{ #include ../src/demo_uniswap/sql/on_reindex/20_create_ca_quotes_1m.sql }}
```
