# Database engines

DipDup officially supports SQLite, PostgreSQL and TimescaleDB as a database engine. This table will help you choose a database engine that mostly suits your needs.

## Features

|                    |       SQLite      |   PostgreSQL  |       TimescaleDB       |
|:------------------|:-----------------:|:-------------:|:-----------------------:|
|    Tested versions |       latest      |   13, 14, 15  |        13, 14, 15       |
|   Best application | early development | general usage | working with timeseries |
|        SQL scripts |         ✅         |       ✅       |            ✅            |
|      Immune tables |         ⚠         |       ✅       |            ✅            |
| Hasura integration |         ❌         |       ✅       |            ✅            |

By default DipDup uses in-memory SQLite database that destroys after the process exits.

While sometimes it's convenient to use one database engine for development and another one for production, be careful with specific column types that behave differently in various engines. However, Tortoise ORM mostly hides these differences.

Immune tables support for SQLite is experimental and requires `advanced.unsafe_sqlite` flag set. Use this feature only for early experiments with database structure, and switch to PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB later.
