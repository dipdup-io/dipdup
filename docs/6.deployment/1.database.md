# Database engines

DipDup officially supports SQLite, PostgreSQL and TimescaleDB as a database engine. This table will help you choose a database engine that mostly suits your needs.

|                      |       SQLite      |   PostgreSQL  |       TimescaleDB       |
|:-------------------- |:-----------------:|:-------------:|:-----------------------:|
| Recommended versions |       latest      |     14, 15    |          14, 15         |
| Best application     | early development | general usage | working with timeseries |
| SQL scripts          |         ✅         |       ✅       |            ✅            |
| Immune tables        |         ⚠         |       ✅       |            ✅            |
| Hasura integration   |         ❌         |       ✅       |            ✅            |

By default DipDup uses in-memory SQLite database that destroys after the process exits.

::banner{type="warning"}
Immune tables support for SQLite is experimental and requires `advanced.unsafe_sqlite` flag set. Use this feature only for early experiments with database structure, and switch to PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB later.
::

Latest PostgreSQL and TimescaleDB versions are recommended due to significant performance improvements in recent releases (see [Feature matrix](https://www.postgresql.org/about/featurematrix/) page).

Usually it's okay no use different database engines for development and production, but be careful with SQL scripts and column types that can behave differently.
