# Running in Docker

DipDup provides prebuilt Docker images hosted on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/dipdup/dipdup). You can use them as is or build custom images based on them.

| [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/dipdup/dipdup)                                             | `dipdup/dipdup:{{ project.dipdup_version }}`            |
| [GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/dipdup-io/dipdup/pkgs/container/dipdup)           | `ghcr.io/dipdup-io/dipdup:{{ project.dipdup_version }}` |
| [GitHub Container Registry (Nightly)](https://github.com/dipdup-io/dipdup/pkgs/container/dipdup) | `ghcr.io/dipdup-io/dipdup:next`                         |

All base images are based on [python:3.12-slim-bookworm](https://hub.docker.com/_/python/tags?name=3.11-slim-bookworm), support amd64 and arm64 architectures. Default user is `dipdup` with UID 1000 and home directory `/home/dipdup`. Entrypoint is set to `dipdup` command.

Nightly builds are published on every push to the `next` branch for developers' convenience. Do not use nightlies in production! You can also use X.Y and X.Y.Z tags to pin to a specific version.

## Usage

To run DipDup in container, you need to copy or mount your project directory and config file to the container.

Given your project source code is in `{{ project.package }}` directory, you can run DipDup container using bind mounts with the following command:

```shell [Terminal]
docker run \
  -v {{ project.package }}:/home/dipdup/{{ project.package }} \
  dipdup/dipdup:{{ project.dipdup_version }}
  -c {{ project.package }} run
```

If you're using SQLite database, you can also mount it as a volume:

```shell [Terminal]
docker run \
  -v {{ project.package }}:/home/dipdup/{{ project.package }} \
  -v {{ project.package }}.sqlite:/home/dipdup/{{ project.package }}.sqlite \
  dipdup/dipdup:{{ project.dipdup_version }}
  -c {{ project.package }} run
```

## Building custom image

Start with creating .dockerignore file for your project if it's missing.

```shell [.dockerignore]
{{ #include ../src/dipdup/projects/base/.dockerignore.j2 }}
```

Then copy your code and config file to the image:

```docker [deploy/Dockerfile]
{{ #include ../src/dipdup/projects/base/deploy/Dockerfile.j2 }}
```

If you need to install additional Python dependencies, just call pip directly during the build stage:

```docker [deploy/Dockerfile]
RUN pip install --no-cache -r requirements.txt
```

## Deploying with Docker Compose

Here's an example `compose.yaml` file:

```yaml [deploy/compose.yaml]
{{ #include ../src/dipdup/projects/base/deploy/compose.yaml.j2 }}
```

Environment variables are expanded in the DipDup config file; PostgreSQL password and Hasura secret are forwarded from host environment in this example.

You can create a separate `dipdup.<environment>.yaml` file for this stack to apply environment-specific config overrides:

```yaml [configs/dipdup.compose.yaml]
{{ #include ../src/dipdup/projects/base/configs/dipdup.compose.yaml.j2 }}
```

Then modify command in `compose.yaml`:

```yaml [deploy/compose.yaml]
services:
  dipdup:
    command: ["dipdup", "-c", "dipdup.yaml", "-c", "dipdup.prod.yaml", "run"]
    ...
```

Note the hostnames (resolved in the docker network) and environment variables (expanded by DipDup).

Build and run the containers:

```shell [Terminal]
docker-compose up -d --build
```

## Deploying with Docker Swarm

Scaffolded projects contain a compose file for Docker Swarm. Before spawning this stack create external networks `traefik-public` and `prometheus-private`. Optionally, deploy Traefik and Prometheus and attach them to these networks to get a fully functional stack.

```yaml [deploy/compose.swarm.yaml]
{{ #include ../src/dipdup/projects/base/deploy/compose.swarm.yaml.j2 }}
```
