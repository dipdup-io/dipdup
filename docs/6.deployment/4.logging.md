# Logging

To control the number of logs DipDup produces, set the `logging` field in config. It can be either a string or a mapping from logger names to logging levels.

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
# Configure dipdup and package loggers
logging: WARN

# Increase verbosity of some loggers
logging:
  dipdup.database: DEBUG
  aiosqlite: DEBUG

# Enable ALL logs
logging:
  '': DEBUG
```

By default only `dipdup` and `{{ project.package }}` namespace loggers are configured. DipDup loggers are usually named after the corresponding module, e.g., `dipdup.database` or `dipdup.index`.

Keep in mind, that excessive logging can affect indexing performance.
