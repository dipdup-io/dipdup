# Prometheus integration

DipDup provides basic integration with the Prometheus monitoring system by exposing some metrics.

When running DipDup in Docker make sure that the Prometheus instance is in the same network.

## Available metrics

The following metrics are exposed under `dipdup` namespace:

| metric name                                    | description                                    |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `dipdup_indexes_total`                         | Number of indexes in operation by status       |
| `dipdup_index_total_sync_duration_seconds`     | Duration of the last synchronization           |
| `dipdup_index_total_realtime_duration_seconds` | Duration of the last realtime queue processing |
| `dipdup_index_levels_to_sync_total`            | Number of levels to reach synced state         |
| `dipdup_index_levels_to_realtime_total`        | Number of levels to reach realtime state       |
| `dipdup_index_handlers_matched_total`          | Index total hits                               |
| `dipdup_datasource_head_updated_timestamp`     | Timestamp of the last head update              |
| `dipdup_datasource_rollbacks_total`            | Number of rollbacks                            |
| `dipdup_http_errors_total`                     | Number of HTTP errors                          |

Also, DipDup exposes the following metrics for compatibility with Subsquid Cloud:

| metric name                                | description                                                |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sqd_processor_last_block`                 | Level of the last processed block from Subsquid Archives   |
| `sqd_processor_chain_height`               | Current chain height as reported by Subsquid Archives      |
| `sqd_processor_archive_http_errors_in_row` | Number of consecutive failed requests to Subsquid Archives |

If you need more complex metrics, consider querying [Internal tables](../5.advanced/3.sql.md#internal-tables).
