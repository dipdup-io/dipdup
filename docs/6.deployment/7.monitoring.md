# Monitoring

To perform up-to-date and freshness checks, DipDup provides a standard REST endpoint you can use together with Betteruptime or similar services that can search for a keyword in the response.

This check says that DipDup is not stuck and keeps receiving new data (the last known block timestamp is not older than **three minutes** from now). Note that this is not enough to ensure everything works as expected. But it can at least cover the cases when datasource API is down or your indexer has crashed.  

## URI format

```text
https://<your-indexer-host>/api/rest/dipdup_head_status?name=<datasource-uri>
```

If you have camel case enabled in the Hasura config:

```text
https://<your-indexer-host>/api/rest/dipdupHeadStatus?name=<datasource-uri>
```

For example:

* [https://domains.dipdup.net/api/rest/dipdup_head_status?name=https://api.tzkt.io](https://domains.dipdup.net/api/rest/dipdup_head_status?name=https://api.tzkt.io)
* [https://juster.dipdup.net/api/rest/dipdupHeadStatus?name=https://api.tzkt.io](https://domains.dipdup.net/api/rest/dipdup_head_status?name=https://api.tzkt.io)

### Response

If the (latest block) head subscription state was updated less than **three minutes** ago, everything is **OK**:

```json
{
  "dipdup_head_status": [
    {
      "status": "OK"
    }
  ]
}
```

Otherwise, the state is considered **OUTDATED**:

```json
{
  "dipdup_head_status": [
    {
      "status": "OUTDATED"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Custom checks

The default check looks like the following:

```sql
CREATE
OR REPLACE VIEW dipdup_head_status AS
SELECT
    name,
    CASE
        WHEN timestamp < NOW() - interval '3 minutes' THEN 'OUTDATED'
        ELSE 'OK'
    END AS status
FROM
    dipdup_head;
```

You can also create your custom alert endpoints using SQL views and functions and then convert them to Hasura REST endpoints.
