# database

DipDup supports several database engines for development and production. The obligatory field `kind` specifies which engine has to be used:

* `sqlite`
* `postgres` (and compatible engines)

{{ #summary deployment/database-engines.md }} article may help you choose a database that better suits your needs.

## SQLite

`path` field must be either path to the .sqlite3 file or `:memory:` to keep a database in memory only (default):

```yaml
database:
  kind: sqlite
  path: db.sqlite3
```

| field | description |
| - | - |
| `kind` | always 'sqlite' |
| `path` | Path to .sqlite3 file, leave default for in-memory database |

## PostgreSQL

Requires `host`, `port`, `user`, `password`, and `database` fields. You can set `schema_name` to values other than `public`, but Hasura integration won't be available.

```yaml
database:
  kind: postgres
  host: db
  port: 5432
  user: dipdup
  password: ${POSTGRES_PASSWORD:-changeme}
  database: dipdup
  schema_name: public
```

| field | description |
| - | - |
| `kind` | always 'postgres' |
| `host` | Host |
| `port` | Port |
| `user` | User |
| `password` | Password |
| `database` | Database name |
| `schema_name` | Schema name |
| `immune_tables` | List of tables to preserve during reindexing |
| `connection_timeout` | Connection timeout in seconds |

<!-- TODO: Move to the upper level -->

You can also use compose-style environment variable substitutions with default values for secrets and other fields. See {{ #summary getting-started/templates-and-variables.md }}.

### Immune tables

You might want to keep several tables during schema wipe if the data in them is not dependent on index states yet heavy. A typical example is indexing IPFS data â€” changes in your code won't affect off-chain storage, so you can safely reuse this data.

```yaml
database:
  immune_tables:
    - ipfs_assets
```

`immune_tables` is an optional array of table names that will be ignored during schema wipe. Once an immune table is created, DipDup will never touch it again; to change the schema of an immune table, you need to perform a migration manually. Check `schema export` output before doing this to ensure the resulting schema is the same as Tortoise ORM would generate.
