# Config file reference

## `advanced`

```yaml
advanced:
  early_realtime: False
  merge_subscriptions: False
  postpone_jobs: False
  reindex:
    manual: wipe
    migration: exception
    rollback: ignore
    config_modified: exception
    schema_modified: exception
```

This config section allows users to tune some system-wide options, either experimental or unsuitable for generic configurations.

| field | description |
| - | - |
| `reindex` | Mapping of reindexing reasons and actions DipDup performs |
| `scheduler` | `apscheduler` scheduler config |
| `postpone_jobs` | Do not start job scheduler until all indexes are in realtime state |
| `early_realtime` | Establish realtime connection immediately after startup |
| `merge_subscriptions` | Subscribe to all operations instead of exact channels |

CLI flags have priority over self-titled `AdvancedConfig` fields.

## contracts

A list of the contracts you can use in the index definitions. Each contract entry has two fields:

* `address` — either originated or implicit account address encoded in base58.
* `typename` — an alias for the particular contract script, meaning that two contracts sharing the same code can have the same type name.

```yaml
contracts:
  kusd_dex_mainnet:
    address: KT1CiSKXR68qYSxnbzjwvfeMCRburaSDonT2
    typename: quipu_fa12
  tzbtc_dex_mainnet:
    address: KT1N1wwNPqT5jGhM91GQ2ae5uY8UzFaXHMJS
    typename: quipu_fa12
  kusd_token_mainnet:
    address: KT1K9gCRgaLRFKTErYt1wVxA3Frb9FjasjTV
    typename: kusd_token
  tzbtc_token_mainnet:
    address: KT1PWx2mnDueood7fEmfbBDKx1D9BAnnXitn
    typename: tzbtc_token
```

If the `typename` field is not set, a contract alias will be used instead.

Contract entry does not contain information about the network, so it's a good idea to include the network name in the alias. This design choice makes possible a generic index parameterization via templates. See [index templates](../1.getting-started/7.indexes.md?index-templates) for details.

If multiple contracts you index have the same interface but different code, see [faq](../10.move-us/3.faq.md) to learn how to avoid conflicts.

## custom

An arbitrary YAML object you can use to store internal indexer configuration.

```yaml
package: my_indexer
...
custom:
  foo: bar
```

Access or modify it from any callback:

```python
ctx.config.custom['foo'] = 'buzz'
```

## database

DipDup supports several database engines for development and production. The obligatory field `kind` specifies which engine has to be used:

* `sqlite`
* `postgres` (and compatible engines)

[Database engines](../6.deployment/1.database.md) article may help you choose a database that better suits your needs.

### SQLite

`path` field must be either path to the .sqlite3 file or `:memory:` to keep a database in memory only (default):

```yaml
database:
  kind: sqlite
  path: db.sqlite3
```

| field | description |
| - | - |
| `kind` | always 'sqlite' |
| `path` | Path to .sqlite3 file, leave default for in-memory database |

### PostgreSQL

Requires `host`, `port`, `user`, `password`, and `database` fields. You can set `schema_name` to values other than `public`, but Hasura integration won't be available.

```yaml
database:
  kind: postgres
  host: db
  port: 5432
  user: dipdup
  password: ${POSTGRES_PASSWORD:-changeme}
  database: dipdup
  schema_name: public
```

| field | description |
| - | - |
| `kind` | always 'postgres' |
| `host` | Host |
| `port` | Port |
| `user` | User |
| `password` | Password |
| `database` | Database name |
| `schema_name` | Schema name |
| `immune_tables` | List of tables to preserve during reindexing |
| `connection_timeout` | Connection timeout in seconds |

<!-- TODO: Move to the upper level -->

You can also use compose-style environment variable substitutions with default values for secrets and other fields. See [dipdup environment variables](../1.getting-started/3.config.md?environment-variables).

#### Immune tables

You might want to keep several tables during schema wipe if the data in them is not dependent on index states yet heavy. A typical example is indexing IPFS data — changes in your code won't affect off-chain storage, so you can safely reuse this data.

```yaml
database:
  immune_tables:
    - ipfs_assets
```

`immune_tables` is an optional array of table names that will be ignored during schema wipe. Once an immune table is created, DipDup will never touch it again; to change the schema of an immune table, you need to perform a migration manually. Check `schema export` output before doing this to ensure the resulting schema is the same as Tortoise ORM would generate.

## datasources

A list of API endpoints DipDup uses to retrieve indexing data to process.

A datasource config entry is an alias for the endpoint URI; there's no network mention. Thus it's good to add a network name to the datasource alias, e.g. `tzkt_mainnet`.

### tzkt

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
datasources:
  tzkt:
    kind: tezos.tzkt
    url: ${TZKT_URL:-https://api.tzkt.io}
    http:
      retry_count:  # retry infinetely
      retry_sleep:
      retry_multiplier:
      ratelimit_rate:
      ratelimit_period:
      connection_limit: 100
      connection_timeout: 60
      batch_size: 10000
    buffer_size: 0
```

### coinbase

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
datasources:
  coinbase:
    kind: coinbase
```

### dipdup-metadata

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
datasources:
  metadata:
    kind: tzip_metadata
    url: https://metadata.dipdup.net
    network: mainnet|ghostnet|mumbainet
```

### ipfs

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
datasources:
  ipfs:
    kind: ipfs
    url: https://ipfs.io/ipfs
```

## hasura

This optional section used by DipDup executor to automatically configure Hasura engine to track your tables.

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
hasura:
  url: http://hasura:8080
  admin_secret: ${HASURA_SECRET:-changeme}
  allow_aggregations: false
  camel_case: true
  rest: true
  select_limit: 100
  source: default
```

## hooks

Hooks are user-defined callbacks you can execute with a job scheduler or within another callback (with `ctx.fire_hook`).

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
hooks:
  calculate_stats:
    callback: calculate_stats
    atomic: False
    args:
     major: bool
     depth: int
```

<!-- TODO: indexes -->

## jobs

Add the following section to DipDup config:

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
jobs:
  midnight_stats:
    hook: calculate_stats
    crontab: "0 0 * * *"
    args:
      major: True
  leet_stats:
    hook: calculate_stats
    interval: 1337  # in seconds
    args:
      major: False
```

If you're unfamiliar with the crontab syntax, an online service [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru/) will help you build the desired expression.

## logging

<!-- TODO: Merge with docs/deployment/logging.md -->

You can configure an amount of logging output by modifying the `logging` field.

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
logging: DEBUG
```

At the moment these values are equal to setting `dipdup` log level to `INFO`, `WARNING` or `DEBUG`, but this may change in the future.

## package

DipDup uses this field to discover the Python package of your project.

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
package: my_indexer_name
```

DipDup will search for a module named `my_module_name` in [`PYTHONPATH`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONPATH) starting from the current working directory.

DipDup configuration file is decoupled from the indexer implementation which gives more flexibility in managing the source code.

See [project package](../1.getting-started/4.package.md) for details.

## prometheus

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
prometheus:
  host: 0.0.0.0

```

Prometheus integration options

| field | description |
| - | - |
| `host` | Host to bind to |
| `port` | Port to bind to |
| `update_interval` | Interval to update some metrics in seconds |

## sentry

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
sentry:
  dsn: https://...
  environment: dev
  debug: False
```

| field | description |
| - | - |
| `dsn` | DSN of the Sentry instance |
| `environment` | Environment to report to Sentry (informational only) |
| `debug` | Catch warning messages and more context |

## spec_version

The DipDup specification version defines the format of the configuration file and available features.

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
spec_version: 2.0
```

This table shows which specific SDK releases support which DipDup file versions.

| `spec_version` value | Supported DipDup versions |
|:-------------------- |:------------------------- |
| 1.0                  | >=1.0, <2.0               |
| 1.1                  | >=2.0, <3.0               |
| 1.2                  | >=3.0, <7.0               |
| 2.0                  | >=7.0                     |

If you're getting `MigrationRequiredError` after updating the framework, run the `dipdup migrate` command to perform project migration.

At the moment, `spec_version` has not changed for a very long time. Consider recreating the package from scratch and migrating logic manually if you have another value in your configuration file.

## templates

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
indexes:
  foo:
    template: bar
    first_level: 12341234
    template_values:
      network: mainnet

templates:
  bar:
    kind: tezos.tzkt.operations
    datasource: tzkt_<network>  # resolves into `tzkt_mainnet`
    ...
```

| field | description |
| - | - |
| `kind` | always `template` |
| `name` | Name of index template |
| `template_values` | Values to be substituted in template (`<key>` → `value`) |
| `first_level` | Level to start indexing from |
| `last_level` | Level to stop indexing at (DipDup will terminate at this level) |
