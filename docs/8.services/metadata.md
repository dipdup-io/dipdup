# metadata

This is an optional section used by the [metadata](https://github.com/dipdup-io/metadata) indexer plugin. It uses [`contracts`](../config/contracts.md) and [`datasources`](../config/datasources.md) aliases as well as the [`database`](../config/database.md) connection.

Metadata configuration has two required sections: `settings` and `indexers`

## Settings

```yaml
metadata:
  settings:
    ipfs_gateways:
      - https://cloudflare-ipfs.com
    ipfs_timeout: 10
    http_timeout: 10
    max_retry_count_on_error: 3
    contract_service_workers: 15
    token_service_workers: 75
  indexers:
    ...
```

### ipfs\_gateways

An array of IPFS gateways. The indexer polls them sequentially until it gets a result or runs out of attempts. It is recommended to specify more than one gateway to overcome propagation issues, rate limits, and other problems.

### ipfs\_timeout

How long DipDup will wait for a single IPFS gateway response. Default value is **10 seconds**.

### http\_timeout

How long DipDup will wait for a HTTP server response. Default value is **10 seconds**.

### max\_retry\_count\_on\_error

If DipDup fails to get a response from IPFS gateway or HTTP server, it will try again after some time, until it runs out of attempts. Default value is **3 attempts**.

### contract\_service\_workers

Count of contract service workers which resolves contract metadata. Default value is 5.

### token\_service\_workers

Count of token service workers which resolves token metadata. Default value is 5.

## Indexers

You can index several networks at once, or go with a single one. Indexer names are not standardized, but for clarity it's better to stick with some meaningful keys:

```yaml
metadata:
  settings:
    ...
  indexers:
    mainnet:
      filters:
        accounts:
          - contract_alias
      datasources:
        tzkt: tzkt_mainnet
```

Each indexer object has two keys: `filters` and `datasources` (required).

### Filters

#### accounts

Array of [contract](../config/contracts.md) aliases used to filter Big\_map updates by the owner contract address.

### Datasources

Metadata plugin is tightly coupled with [TzKT](../config/datasources.md#tzkt) provider.

#### tzkt

An alias pointing to a [datasource](../config/datasources.md) of kind `tzkt` is expected.
