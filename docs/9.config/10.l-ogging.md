# logging

<!-- TODO: Merge with docs/deployment/logging.md -->

You can configure an amount of logging output by modifying the `logging` field.

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
logging: DEBUG
```

At the moment these values are equal to setting `dipdup` log level to `INFO`, `WARNING` or `DEBUG`, but this may change in the future.
