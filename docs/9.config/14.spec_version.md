# spec_version

The DipDup specification version defines the format of the configuration file and available features.

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
spec_version: 2.0
```

This table shows which specific SDK releases support which DipDup file versions.

| `spec_version` value | Supported DipDup versions |
|:-------------------- |:------------------------- |
| 1.0                  | >=1.0, <2.0               |
| 1.1                  | >=2.0, <3.0               |
| 1.2                  | >=3.0, <7.0               |
| 2.0                  | >=7.0                     |

If you're getting `MigrationRequiredError` after updating the framework, run the `dipdup migrate` command to perform project migration.

At the moment, `spec_version` has not changed for a very long time. Consider recreating the package from scratch and migrating logic manually if you have another value in your configuration file.
