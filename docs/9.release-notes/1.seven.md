# 7.0.0 Pre-release 1

Welcome, developers. We're pleased to present DipDup 7.0.0, the first pre-release of a substantial update. After six months of rigorous development, we've compiled a comprehensive set of new features, improvements, and enhancements.

## Key Features

### EVM Support

Broaden your horizons with the addition of EVM-compatible blockchain support. Use the pre-made demo projects to get started.

### Performance Improvements

DipDup is now more efficient, with Python 3.11 compatibility, HTTP pre-fetching, and enhanced database interaction via the redefined [DipDup ORM](../1.getting-started/5.models.md?DipDup-ORM).

### Improved Environment and Deployment

We've simplified and streamlined the [Project package](../1.getting-started/4.package.md). Benefit from a deployment-ready folder, optimized Docker images, and an easier process for managing crash reports.
