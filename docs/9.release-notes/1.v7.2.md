# Release Notes: 7.2

## Indexing Tezos Etherlink smart rollups

Etherlink is an EVM-compatible smart rollup, which prioritizes fair ordering of transactions, low latency and security.

Smart rollups are Tezosâ€™ permissionless L2 scaling solution. They are WASM applications, providing versatility in what language you write them in. You can learn more in [Etherlink docs](https://docs.etherlink.com/welcome/what-is-etherlink)

Since version 7.2 you can index Etherlink smart rollups like usual Tezos contracts. Choose `demo_etherlink` template when creating a new project:

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
{{ #include ../src/demo_etherlink/dipdup.yaml }}
```

Etherlink rollups' addresses start with `sr1` prefix instead of `KT1`, and entrypoint is always `default`. If you omit entrypoint in the operation pattern, the transaction will be treated as untyped.

See the [Package](../2.indexes/5.tezos_tzkt_operations.md) page for more details.

## API to add indexes in runtime

One of the cool features of DipDup is that you can add indexes in runtime using `ctx.add_contract/add_index` methods from any callback. Now we have a basic HTTP API for the same purpose. To use it, add `api` section to your config:

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
api:
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 46339  # dial INDEX ðŸ˜Ž
```

Now use your favorite HTTP client to manage DipDup.

```shell
# Add contract
curl 127.0.0.1:46339/add_contract -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"kind":"tezos", "name": "LB", "typename": "dex" "address": "KT1TxqZ8QtKvLu3V3JH7Gx58n7Co8pgtpQU5"}'

# Add index from the template
curl 127.0.0.1:46339/add_index -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"template":"dex_template", "name": "LB_index", "values": {"contract": "LB"}}'

# Check how DipDup is doing
curl 127.0.0.1:46339/performance
```

See the [API reference](../7.references/5.api.md) for more details.
