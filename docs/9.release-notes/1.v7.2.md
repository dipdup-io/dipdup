# Release Notes: 7.2

## Indexing Tezos Etherlink smart rollups

Etherlink is an EVM-compatible smart rollup, which prioritizes fair ordering of transactions, low latency and security.

Smart rollups are Tezosâ€™ permissionless L2 scaling solution. They are WASM applications, providing versatility in what language you write them in. You can learn more in [Etherlink docs](https://docs.etherlink.com/welcome/what-is-etherlink)

Since version 7.2 you can index Etherlink smart rollups like usual Tezos contracts. Choose `demo_etherlink` template when creating a new project:

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
{{ #include ../src/demo_etherlink/dipdup.yaml }}
```

Etherlink rollups' addresses start with `sr1` prefix instead of `KT1`, and entrypoint is always `default`. If you omit entrypoint in the operation pattern, the transaction will be treated as untyped.

See the [Package](../2.indexes/5.tezos_tzkt_operations.md) page for more details.
