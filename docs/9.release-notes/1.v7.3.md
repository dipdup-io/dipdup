# Release Notes: 7.3

We're glad to announce DipDup 7.3! This release brings better support for Etherlink smart rollups and a bunch of minor improvements.

## Indexing `sr_execute` operations on Tezos

We continue to improve support for Etherlink smart rollups introduced in 7.2. In case you've missed it, Etherlink is an EVM-compatible smart rollup on Tezos, which prioritizes fair ordering of transactions, low latency and security. They are WASM applications, providing versatility in what language you write them in.

Now you can index `sr_execute` operations with DipDup. This is a special operation created when rollup outbox messages are executed. You can filter them by `sr1` source/destination address. `demo_etherlink` demo project was updated to reflect these changes. It's an indexer for a bridge contract having two handlers, for depositing tokens to the rollup address (L1 -> L2) and for withdrawing them (L2 -> L1).

To use this demo as a template for your own Etherlink project, run `dipdup new` and choose `demo_etherlink` template.
