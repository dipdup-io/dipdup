# Release Notes: 8.0

::banner{type="warning"}
This page describes pre-release version of DipDup. API and features are subject to change.
::

Welcome to DipDup 8.0 release notes! In this major release, we continue expanding DipDup's capabilities, improving indexing performance and developer experience. Key highlights of this release are:

- Starknet support üê∫
- Updated Python 3.12 environment
- New config specification
- Useful CLI commands, tunables and other QoL improvements

## GM, Starknet users!

[Starknet](https://docs.starknet.io/) is a permissionless zero-knowledge (ZK) rollup that operates on top of Ethereum, enabling dApps to achieve massive computation scale without compromising on Ethereum‚Äôs composability and security.

We welcome Starknet to the big family of DipDup-supported networks! DipDup 8.0 introduces a new index kind `starknet.events` and a new datasource `starknet.subsquid` to work with Starknet events; more data types to come in the future.

Starknet contracts are written in [Cairo](https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo), a custom-built and specialized programming language. But as a DipDup user, you don't need to know Cairo to start working with Starknet. Just add the index definition to your project and DipDup will generate Python types and handler stubs for you.

To start creating your indexer, run `dipdup new` and select `demo_starknet_events` project as a template.

## Updated Python 3.12 environment

DipDup environment has been updated to Python 3.12, bringing new language features and performance improvements to the table. Other notable updates include pydantic 2.2, web3 6.18 and tortoise-orm 0.21.2.

## New config specification

DipDup 8.0 introduces a new config specification. Now index definitions can contain any number of attached datasources instead of a single main one. Index kinds were updated to reflect this change.

```yaml
spec_version: 3.0  # <- was `2.0`
package: demo_evm_events

indexes:
  eth_usdt_events:
    kind: evm.events  # <- was `evm.subsquid.events`
    datasources:  # <- replacing `datasource` key
      - subsquid
      - etherscan
      - evm_node
```

Existing projects require semi-automatic migration. Please refer to the [migration guide](#migration-from-7.5) for more details.

## Migration from 7.5

To migrate existing projects to 8.0, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python 3.12 installed.
2. Update DipDup to 8.0 in your project. For `pdm` users, update the following lines in `pyproject.toml` and run `pdm venv create -f && pdm update`:

```toml
requires-python = ">=3.12,<3.13"
dependencies = [
    "dipdup>=8,<9",
]
```

3. Run `dipdup migrate` command. It will update your config files and generate a new package structure.
4. ...

DipDup 7.5 release is going to be supported for 6 months after the stable release of 8.0. During this period, we will provide bug fixes and security updates.
