# Release Notes: 8.0

::banner{type="warning"}
This page describes pre-release version of DipDup. API and features are subject to change.
::

Welcome to DipDup 8.0 release notes! This major release expands DipDup's functionality and improves indexing performance and developer experience. Key highlights of this release are:

- Starknet support üê∫
- Updated Python 3.12 environment
- New config specification
- Useful CLI commands, tunables and other quality-of-life improvements

## GM, Starknet users

[Starknet](https://docs.starknet.io/) is a permissionless zero-knowledge (ZK) rollup that operates on top of Ethereum, enabling dApps to achieve massive computational scale without compromising on Ethereum‚Äôs composability and security.

We welcome Starknet to the large family of DipDup-supported networks! DipDup 8.0 introduces a new index kind `starknet.events` and a new datasource `starknet.subsquid` to work with Starknet events. Support for optional node datasources and more index kinds is coming soon.

Starknet contracts are written in [Cairo](https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo), a specialized programming language. It's not EVM-compatible, but many concepts are similar. As a DipDup user, you don't need to know the difference in detail to start working with Starknet. Just add the index definition to the project config, place the contract ABI to `abi/<typename>/cairo_abi.json` and DipDup will generate Python types and handler stubs for you. You can use [Starkscan](https://starkscan.co/contract/0x068f5c6a61780768455de69077e07e89787839bf8166decfbf92b645209c0fb8#class-code-history) explorer to get the ABI and other information about the contract.

To start building your indexer, run `dipdup new` and select the `demo_starknet_events` project as a template.

## Updated Python 3.12 environment

One of the DipDup features is a unified Python environment across all projects to simplify deployment and maintenance. DipDup indexers now run on Python 3.12, enhancing both language features and performance. We've also updated our core dependencies to their latest versions, including:

- pydantic 2.7 with significantly faster (de)serialization and powerful validators.
- tortoise-orm 0.21.2 with better Pydantic integration and a bunch of bugfixes and optimizations.
- web3 6.19 with the latest EIP and RPC changes.

For more details, refer to the changelog. The update has also led to higher and more consistent indexing throughput; our tests show an average performance improvement of 10-20%. We are going to continue working on performance optimization in the future.

## New config specification

DipDup 8.0 introduces an updated configuration specification for better flexibility and extensibility. Previously, every index definition was linked to a single "index datasource", which in turn could be linked to one or more complementary ones. This approach appeared to be limiting, and also confusing, since Subsquid and node RPC datasources could be used interchangeably despite the difference in indexing speed.

In the new spec version 3.0, an index can have any number of attached datasources. DipDup will choose the most suitable one for each stage of the process. For load balancing purposes, if multiple node datasources are attached, a random one will be chosen for each request. When applicable, DipDup will consider the order of datasources in the config file.

The naming convention for index kinds has been updated to reflect these changes. They now consist of two parts: network and data type, without the datasource one.

```yaml
spec_version: 3.0  # <- was `2.0`
package: demo_evm_events

indexes:
  eth_usdt_events:
    kind: evm.events  # <- was `evm.subsquid.events`
    datasources:  # <- replacing `datasource` key
      - subsquid
      - etherscan
      - evm_node
      - another_evm_node
```

## Migration from 7.5

Existing projects require semi-automatic migration. Please follow the steps below to update your project to DipDup 8.0.

<!-- TODO: Remove arguments after dash and subdomain with a stable release -->
1. Make sure you have Python 3.12 installed.
2. Update the current DipDup installation. Run `dipdup self uninstall`, then `curl -Lsf https://dev.dipdup.io/install.py | python3.12 - --pre`.
3. Enter the project directory, but do not activate the virtual environment. Run the `dipdup migrate` command. It will update your config files and generate a new package structure. Modules requiring manual migration will be moved to `<module>.old` path; leave them as is for now. Review and commit the changes.
4. Run `dipdup init --base --force` command to update pyproject.toml and other metadata files. Recreate and enter the virtual environment. For PDM run `rm -rf .venv pdm.lock && pdm venv create python3.12 && pdm install && $(pdm venv activate)`. For Poetry run `rm -rf .venv poetry.lock && poetry install && poetry shell`. Review and commit the changes.
5. Move the callback function bodies from `<module>.old` to `<module>` files. Review and commit the changes.
6. Run `make all` to check if everything works as expected. Fix any errors and commit the changes.

<!-- TODO: Update dates -->
DipDup 7.5 release is going to be supported for 6 months after the stable release of 8.0. During this period, we will provide bug fixes and security updates.
