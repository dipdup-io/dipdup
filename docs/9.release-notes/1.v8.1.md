# Release Notes: 8.1

This release was created during the [ODHack 8.0](https://app.onlydust.com/hackathons/odhack-80) event by the following participants:

@bigherc18 contributed support for database migrations using the Aerich tool. This optional integration allows to manage database migrations with the `dipdup schema` commands. See the [Migrations](../1.getting-started/5.database.md#migrations) section to learn to enable and use this integration.

@JoE11-y contributed an interactive config generator. Now you can create a working DipDup config without knowing the syntax, just answering the questions. Run `dipdup new` command and choose "Interactively" to try it out.

@tosoham contributed the `hide` and `hide_internal` config options to make tables/views private in Hasura API. See the [Hasura config reference](https://dipdup.io/docs/references/config#dipdupconfighasuraconfig).

@MrRoudyk contributed improvements to the version checker, so you'll never miss an update. And @fabrobles92 improved the readability of app reports.

Thank you!
