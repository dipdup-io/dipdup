description: DipDup 6.5 release notes
---

DipDup 6.5 is the current old-stable release powering dozens of APIs in production. **It will be supported until March 2024**. We want to give teams enough time for migration or to wait a bit while the current branch is being ironed out. We will continue to release bugfixes and security updates until that date. You can find the old documentation [here](https://docs.dipdup.io/), but some pages may be outdated. If you've found such a page or other issue, please drop us a message.
