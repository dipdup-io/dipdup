# Release Notes: 7.4

We're glad to announce DipDup 7.4! This release brings support for EVM transactions indexing in addition to existing EVM event logs index.

## Indexing EVM transactions

DipDup 7.4 introduces a new index kind for processing EVM transactions. Transactions can be filtered by one or more of the following fields: `from.address`, `to.address`, `method`. You can define handlers for multiple sets of filters. Only necessary transactions are fetched and processed. If both "to" and "method" filters are specified, DipDup will generate a typeclass for particular input from contract ABI. Otherwise, you will have to handle untyped input data.

We have created a new demo project to showcase the new index kind, `demo_evm_transactions`. It's basic indexer for USDt contract token transfers.

To create a project based on this template, run `dipdup new -t demo_evm_transactions`.

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
indexes:
  eth_usdt_transactions:
    kind: evm.subsquid.transactions
    datasource: subsquid
    handlers:
      - callback: on_transfer
        to: eth_usdt
        method: transfer
    first_level: 4634748
```
