# Release Notes: 7.2

We're glad to announce DipDup 7.2! This release brings Etherlink smart rollup compatibility, API for managing indexes in runtime, and a bunch of minor improvements.

## Indexing Tezos Etherlink smart rollups

Etherlink is an EVM-compatible smart rollup, which prioritizes fair ordering of transactions, low latency and security.

Smart rollups are Tezosâ€™ permissionless L2 scaling solution. They are WASM applications, providing versatility in what language you write them in. You can learn more in [Etherlink docs](https://docs.etherlink.com/)

Since version 7.2 you can index Etherlink smart rollups like regular Tezos contracts. Choose `demo_etherlink` template when creating a new project:

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
spec_version: 2.0
package: demo_etherlink

datasources:
  tzkt:
    kind: tezos.tzkt
    url: ${TZKT_URL:-https://api.tzkt.io}

contracts:
  controller:
    kind: tezos
    address: KT1Ax1oGGjooakyYJvtrX3q5zxRwYv6EAeC2
    typename: controller
  rollup:
    kind: tezos
    address: sr1SW7VtD6xbSAEoRk8LXewr3igfWjBx7FPB
    typename: rollup

indexes:
  rollup_operations:
    kind: tezos.tzkt.operations
    datasource: tzkt
    contracts:
      - controller
      - rollup
    handlers:
      - callback: on_rollup_call
        pattern:
          - type: transaction
            destination: controller
            entrypoint: default
            alias: controller_default
          - type: transaction
            destination: rollup
            entrypoint: default
            alias: rollup_default
```

Etherlink rollups' addresses start with the `sr1` prefix instead of `KT1`, and an entrypoint is always `default`. If you omit an entrypoint in the operation pattern, the transaction will be treated as untyped.

See the [tezos.tzkt.operations](../2.indexes/6.tezos_tzkt_operations.md) page for more details.

## API to add indexes in runtime

One of the cool features of DipDup is that you can add indexes in runtime using `ctx.add_contract/add_index` methods from any callback. Now a basic HTTP API is available for the same purpose. To use it, add `api` section to your config:

```yaml [dipdup.yaml]
api:
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 46339  # dial INDEX ðŸ˜Ž
```

Now you can use your favorite HTTP client to manage DipDup:

```shell
# Add contract
curl 127.0.0.1:46339/add_contract -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"kind":"tezos", "name": "LB", "typename": "dex" "address": "KT1TxqZ8QtKvLu3V3JH7Gx58n7Co8pgtpQU5"}'

# Add index from the template
curl 127.0.0.1:46339/add_index -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"template":"dex_template", "name": "LB_index", "values": {"contract": "LB"}}'

# Check how DipDup is doing
curl 127.0.0.1:46339/performance
```

See the [API reference](../7.references/4.api.md) for more details.

## Other improvements

`make` is back! After gathering feedback from the community we decided to return `Makefile` to the base template, but _make_ it package manager-agnostic. Instead, when creating a new project DipDup suggests choosing a package manager from PDM/Poetry/None (sets `package_manager` field in `replay.yaml` config). No action is required for existing projects, but you can run `dipdup init --base [--force]` to update the project base.

Indexing EVM events with node RPC (`evm.node` datasource) has become faster. Node RPC while inherently slow, is used only for the "last mile" indexing (fetching a few hundred latest blocks not yet in Subsquid Network API) and realtime subscriptions.

Finally, we have sped up the generation of Pydantic typeclasses with `datamodel-codegen`. Also, resulting classes use `X | Y` union syntax when possible.

## Changes since 7.1

### Added

- api: Added HTTP API to manage a running indexer.
- cli: Added `DIPDUP_CONFIG` and `DIPDUP_ENV_FILE` environment variables corresponding to `--config` and `--env-file` options.
- config: Added `http.request_timeout` option to set the total timeout for HTTP requests.
- evm.subsquid: Added Prometheus metrics required for Subsquid Cloud deployments.
- project: Added Makefile to the default project template (only for new projects).
- project: Added optional `package_manager` field to replay config.
- tezos.tzkt: Added support for Etherlink smart rollups (`sr1â€¦` addresses).

### Fixed

- cli: Don't suppress uncaught exceptions when performance monitoring is disabled.
- codegen: Use datamodel-code-generator from the project's virtualenv.
- evm.node: Fixed an issue with realtime subscriptions which led to indexing being stuck in some cases.
- evm.node: Fixed crash on anonymous event logs during the last mile indexing.
- evm.node: Raise an exception when no realtime messages have been received in `http.connection_timeout` seconds.
- evm.subsquid: Last mile indexing is significantly faster now.
- http: Use `request_timeout` instead of `connection_timeout` for total timeout.
- install: Don't install datamodel-code-generator as a CLI tool.
- install: Respect package manager if specified in pyproject.toml.
- tezos.tzkt: Fixed an issue with approving schema after reindexing triggered by rollback.

### Performance

- evm.subsquid.events: Request logs in batches to speed up the last mile indexing.

### Security

- deps: Updated PyArrow to 14.0.1 to fix [CVE-2023-47248](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5wvp-7f3h-6wmm)
