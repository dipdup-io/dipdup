# Default hooks

Every DipDup project has multiple hooks called default; they fire on system-wide events and, like regular hooks, are not linked to any index. Names of those hooks are reserved; you can't use them in config.

## `on_index_rollback`

Fires when TzKT datasource has received a chain reorg message which can't be processed automatically.

If your indexer is stateless, you can just drop DB data saved after `to_level` and continue indexing. Otherwize, implement more complex logic. By default, this hook triggers full reindexing.

## `on_restart`

This hook executes right before starting indexing. It allows configuring DipDup in runtime based on data from external sources. Datasources are already initialized at execution and available at `ctx.datasources`. You can, for example, configure logging here or add contracts and indexes in runtime instead of from static config.

## `on_reindex`

This hook fires after the database are re-initialized after reindexing (wipe). Helpful in modifying schema with arbitrary SQL scripts before indexing.

## `on_synchronized`

This hook fires when every active index reaches a realtime state. Here you can clear caches internal caches or do other cleanups.
