# Core concepts

## Big picture

Initially, DipDup was heavily inspired by [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) Protocol, but there are several differences. The most important one is that DipDup indexers are completely off-chain.

DipDup utilizes a microservice approach and relies heavily on existing solutions, making the SDK very lightweight and allowing developers to switch API engines on demand.

DipDup works with operation groups (explicit operation and all internal ones, a single contract call) and _Big\_map_ updates (lazy hash map structures, [read more](https://tezostaquito.io/docs/maps_bigmaps/)) â€” until fully-fledged protocol-level events are not implemented in Tezos.

Consider DipDup a set of best practices for building custom backends for decentralized applications, plus a toolkit that spares you from writing boilerplate code.

DipDup is tightly coupled with [TzKT API](http://api.tzkt.io/) but can generally use any data provider which implements a particular feature set. TzKT provides REST endpoints and Websocket subscriptions with flexible filters enabling selective indexing and returns "humanified" contract data, which means you don't have to handle raw Michelson expressions.

DipDup offers PostgreSQL + Hasura GraphQL Engine combo out-of-the-box to expose indexed data via REST and GraphQL with minimal configuration. However, you can use any database and API engine (e.g., write API backend in-house).

## How it works

From the developer's perspective, there are three main steps for creating an indexer using the DipDup framework:

1. Write a declarative configuration file containing all the inventory and indexing rules.
2. Describe your domain-specific data models.
3. Implement the business logic, which is how to convert blockchain data to your models.

As a result, you get a service responsible for filling the database with the indexed data.

Within this service, there can be multiple indexers running independently.

## Atomicity and persistency

DipDup applies all updates atomically block by block. In case of an emergency shutdown, it can safely recover later and continue from the level it ended. DipDup state is stored in the database per index and can be used by API consumers to determine the current indexer head.

Here are a few essential things to know before running your indexer:

* Ensure that the database (or schema in the case of PostgreSQL) you're connecting to is used by DipDup exclusively. Changes in index configuration or models require DipDup to **drop the whole database (schema)** and start indexing from scratch. You can, however, mark specific tables as immune to preserve them from being dropped.
* Changing index config triggers reindexing. Also, do not change aliases of existing indexes in the config file without cleaning up the database first. DipDup won't handle that automatically and will treat the renamed index as new.
* Multiple indexes pointing to different contracts should not reuse the same models (unless you know what you are doing) because synchronization is done sequentially by index.

## Schema migration

DipDup does not support database schema migration: if there's any model change, it will trigger reindexing. The rationale is that it's easier and faster to start over than handle migrations that can be of arbitrary complexity and do not guarantee data consistency.

DipDup stores a hash of the SQL version of the DB schema and checks for changes each time you run indexing.

## Handling chain reorgs

Reorg messages signaling chain reorganizations. That means some blocks, including all operations, are rolled back in favor of another with higher fitness. Chain reorgs happen regularly (especially in [testnets](https://teztnets.xyz/)), so it's not something you can ignore. These messages must be handled correctly -- otherwise, you will likely accumulate duplicate or invalid data.

Singe version 6.0 DipDup processes chain reorgs seamlessly restoring a previous database state. You can implement your rollback logic by editing the `on_index_rollback` event hook.
