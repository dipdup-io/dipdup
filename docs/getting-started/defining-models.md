# Defining models

DipDup uses the Tortoise ORM library to cover database operations. During initialization, DipDup generates a `models.py` file on the top level of the package that will contain all database models. The name and location of this file cannot be changed.

A typical `models.py` file looks like the following:

```python
from tortoise import Tortoise, fields
from tortoise.models import Model


class Event(Model):
    id = fields.IntField(pk=True)
    name = fields.TextField()
    datetime = fields.DatetimeField(null=True)
```

See the links below to learn how to use this library.

## Limitations

There are some limitations introduced to make Hasura GraphQL integration easier.

* Table names must be in `snake_case`
* Model fields must be in `snake_case`
* Model fields must differ from table name
