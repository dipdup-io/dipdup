# Defining models

DipDup uses the Tortoise ORM library to cover database operations. During initialization, DipDup generates a `models.py` file on the top level of the package that will contain all database models. The name and location of this file cannot be changed.

A typical `models.py` file looks like the following (example from `demo_tezos_domains` package):

```python
{{ #include ../../src/demo_tezos_domains/models.py }}
```

See the links below to learn how to use this library.

## Limitations

* Table names must be in `snake_case`
* Model fields must be in `snake_case`
* Model fields must differ from table name
