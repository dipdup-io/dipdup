# Installation

This page covers the installation of DipDup in different environments.

## Host requirements

A *Linux*/*MacOS* environment with *Python 3.10* installed is required to use DipDup. Other UNIX-like systems should work but are not supported officially.

Minimum hardware requirements are 256 MB RAM, 1 CPU core, and some disk space for the database. RAM requirements increase with the number of indexes.

### Non-UNIX environments

DipDup currently doesn't work in Windows environments due to incompatibilities in libraries it depends on. Please use WSL or Docker.

We aim to improve cross-platform compatibility in future releases ([issue](https://github.com/dipdup-net/dipdup-py/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3A%22%F0%9F%9A%A2+ci%2Fcd%22+sort%3Aupdated-desc+)).

## Local installation

### Interactively (recommended)

You can initialize a hello-world project interactively by choosing configuration options in the terminal. The following command will install [`cookiecutter`](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/README.html) and create a new project in the current directory.

```shell
sh <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dipdup-net/dipdup-py/master/install.sh)
```

### Poetry

We advise using the [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) package manager for new projects. However, it's not a requirement. If you prefer pdb, piptools, pipenv or other tools â€” use them instead.

```shell
# Create a new project
mkdir my-indexer; cd my-indexer
poetry init --python ">=3.10,<3.11"
# Add dipdup as a dependency
poetry add dipdup
# Enter the virtualenv
poetry shell
```

### pip

Create a new virtual environment and install DipDup in it.

```shell
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install dipdup
```

## Docker

See {{ #summary deployment/docker.md }} page.
