# Quickstart

This page will guide you through the steps to get your first selective indexer up and running in a few minutes without getting too deep into the details.

Let's create an indexer for the [tzBTC FA1.2 token contract](https://tzkt.io/KT1PWx2mnDueood7fEmfbBDKx1D9BAnnXitn/operations/). Our goal is to save all token transfers to the database and then calculate some statistics of its holders' activity.

A modern Linux/macOS distribution with Python 3.10 installed is required to run DipDup.

## Create a new project

### Interactively (recommended)

You can initialize a hello-world project interactively by choosing configuration options in the terminal. The following command will install DipDup for the current user:

```shell
python -c "$(curl -sSL https://dipdup-net.github.io/dipdup/install.py)"
```

Now, let's create a new project:

```shell
dipdup new
```

Follow the instructions; the project will be created in the current directory. You can skip reading the rest of this page and slap `dipdup run` instead.

### From scratch

Currently, we mainly use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) for dependency management in DipDup. If you prefer hatch, pdb, piptools or others â€” use them instead. Below are some snippets to get you started.

```shell
# Create a new project directory
mkdir dipdup-indexer; cd dipdup-indexer

# Plain pip
python -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install dipdup

# or Poetry
poetry init --python ">=3.10,<3.11"
poetry add dipdup
poetry shell
```

## Write a configuration file

DipDup configuration is stored in YAML files of a specific format. Create a new file named `dipdup.yml` in your current working directory with the following content:

```yaml
{{ #include ../demos/demo-tzbtc/dipdup.yml }}
```

> * {{ #summary config/README.md}}

## Initialize project tree

Now it's time to generate typeclasses and callback stubs. Run the following command:

```shell
dipdup init
```

DipDup will create a Python package `demo_tzbtc` having the following structure:

```text
demo_tzbtc
â”œâ”€â”€ graphql
â”œâ”€â”€ handlers
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ on_mint.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ on_transfer.py
â”œâ”€â”€ hooks
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ on_reindex.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ on_restart.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ on_index_rollback.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ on_synchronized.py
â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”œâ”€â”€ models.py
â”œâ”€â”€ sql
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ on_reindex
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ on_restart
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ on_index_rollback
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ on_synchronized
â””â”€â”€ types
    â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
    â””â”€â”€ tzbtc
        â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
        â”œâ”€â”€ parameter
        â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
        â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ mint.py
        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ transfer.py
        â””â”€â”€ storage.py
```

That's a lot of files and directories! But don't worry, we will need only `models.py` and `handlers` modules in this guide.

## Define data models

Our schema will consist of a single model `Holder` having several fields:

* `address` â€” account address
* `balance` â€” in tzBTC
* `volume` â€” total transfer/mint amount bypassed
* `tx_count` â€” number of transfers/mints
* `last_seen` â€” time of the last transfer/mint

Put the following content in the `models.py` file:

```python
{{ #include ../demos/demo-tzbtc/src/demo_tzbtc/models.py }}
```

> * [Tortoise ORM examples](https://tortoise-orm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html)

## Implement handlers

Everything's ready to implement an actual indexer logic.

Our task is to index all the balance updates, so we'll start with a helper method to handle them. Create a file named `on_balance_update.py` in the `handlers` package with the following content:

```python
{{ #include ../demos/demo-tzbtc/src/demo_tzbtc/handlers/on_balance_update.py }}
```

Three methods of tzBTC contract can alter token balances â€” `transfer`, `mint`, and `burn`. The last one is omitted in this tutorial for simplicity. Edit corresponding handlers to call the `on_balance_update` method with data from matched operations:

`on_transfer.py`

```python
{{ #include ../demos/demo-tzbtc/src/demo_tzbtc/handlers/on_transfer.py }}
```

`on_mint.py`

```python
{{ #include ../demos/demo-tzbtc/src/demo_tzbtc/handlers/on_mint.py }}
```

And that's all! We can run the indexer now.

## Run your indexer

```shell
dipdup run
```

DipDup will fetch all the historical data and then switch to realtime updates. Your application data has been successfully indexed!
