# 6.0.0 (unreleased)

## âš  Breaking Changes

* `on_rollback` deprecated in 5.1.0 has been removed.
* Project models must be subclassed from `dipdup.models.Model`.
* `bulk_create` and `bulk_update` model methods are no longer supported.
* An internal `ModelUpdate` model has been added.

## âš  Migration from 5.x

* Remove `on_rollback` hook if it persists in your project. Ensure that the `on_index_rollback` hook is valid.
* Replace `tortoise.Model` import with `dipdup.models.Model` in your `models.py` module.
* Replace `bulk_create` and `bulk_update` calls with multiple `create`/`save`/`update` ones. Performance impact should be negligible since queries from each level are executed in a single database transaction.
* Run `schema approve` command with every schema you want to use with DipDup 6.0.  

## What's New

### Seamless database-level rollbacks

```yaml
advanced:
  rollback_depth: 2
```

```python
await ctx.rollback(
    index=index.name,
    from_level=from_level,
    to_level=to_level,
)
```
