# DipDup 7.0.0b1

_(WIP, don't read it lmao)_

Cheers, developers! Do you keep your head warm and your feet dry this crypto winter? You'd better do, cause the next season is gonna be awesome, and it would be a pity to miss smart-contracts blossom laying in bed with a cold. Ok, enough silly jokes. 7.0 release is finally ready enough for the first beta. After half a year of active development, the amount of new features is HUGE, but we hope that updated docs and lots of examples won't let you get lost. If you're updating from 6.5, keep an eye on "Migration" sections on this page.

Key highlights for this release:

- Support for EVM-compatible blockchains.
- Updated, simplier package structure.
- Powerful tools for monitoring and performance tuning.
- Flexible deployment recipes for any environment.
- More datasources, indexes and helpers.

Bigger and better like they say. Now, to the details.

## What's New

### EVM support

- what are EVM, Subsquid Archives, RPC nodes
- bootstrapping EVM demo
- `abi.etherscan` datasource, manual
- node datasources, configuration
- event matching rules

### New package structure

- root config, .yaml default
- fixed sections
- new: configs, deploy; later in Deployment
- nested models
- ignore files; `package tree` command

### Deployment

- updated docker image
- compose files and env.default

### Tezos

- `tezos.tzkt.operations_unfiltered` index

#### The crash reporting flag has been removed

First of all, Sentry integration is not affected by this change!

Opt-in `advanced.crash_reporting` flag was introduced in v6.0 to allow sending Sentry events to our public instance. We expected that the gathered reports will help us to improve DipDup stability. It turned out, the cons of this approach outweigh the pros. Very few users have enabled this feature, and most of the reports sent were not helpful. Don't get me wrong, Sentry is a great piece of software. It's just not the best fit for crash reporting when a majority of executed code is either written user or generated. Also, these circumstances increase the risk of leaking sensitive data. So, we decided to shift the focus to plaintext human-friendly crash dumps. See the next section to learn how to use them. Again, if you use Sentry, you can still use it with DipDup. We'll continue to support and improve Sentry integration; we use it in our in-house projects too.

### Miscellaneous

Event hooks are now called system hooks. All the blockchains we support have entities called events (of smart contracts), and that creates ambiguity. Nothing has changed except the name; you don't need to update your code of config.

`advanced.metadata_interface` config option has been removed. This flag allowed using `update_token_metadata` and `update_contract_metadata` methods, which are now available by default. You can remove it from the config.
