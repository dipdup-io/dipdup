### Miscellaneous

Event hooks are now called system hooks. All the blockchains we support have entities called events (of smart contracts), and that creates ambiguity. Nothing has changed except the name; you don't need to update your code of config.

`advanced.metadata_interface` config option has been removed. This flag allowed using `update_token_metadata` and `update_contract_metadata` methods, which are now available by default. You can remove it from the config.
