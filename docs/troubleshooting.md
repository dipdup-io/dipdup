# Troubleshooting

This page contains tips for troubleshooting DipDup projects.

## Update DipDup to the latest version

DipDup framework evolves rapidly just like Tezos itself does. We recommend keeping your project up-to-date with the latest version of DipDup.

If you're using Poetry, set caret version constraint in `pyproject.toml` to use the latest release of the current major version:

```toml
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
dipdup = "^6.0.0"
```

Run `poetry update dipdup` periodically to update to the latest version.

While building Docker images you can use `X` and `X.Y` tags to lock to specific major/minor releases:

```Dockerfile
FROM dipdup/dipdup:6.0
```

## Ensure that config is correct

DipDup config can be correct syntactically but not necessarily semantically. It's especially easy to make a mistake when actively using templates and environment variables. Use `config export` command to dump config the way DipDup "sees" it, after resolving all links and templates. `config env` command can help you to find missing environment variables.

```shell
dipdup -c dipdup.yml -c dipdup.prod.yml config export
dipdup -c dipdup.yml -c dipdup.prod.yml config env
```
