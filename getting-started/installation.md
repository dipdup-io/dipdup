# Installation

This page covers the installation of DipDup in differens environments.

## Host requirements

A Linux environment with Python 3.10+ installed is required to use DipDup.

Minimum hardware requirements are 256 MB RAM, 1 CPU core, and some disk space for the database.

### Non-Linux environments

Other UNIX-like systems (MacOS, FreeBSD etc.) should work, however not supported officially.

DipDup currently doesn't work in Windows environments due to incompabilities in libraries it depends on. Please use WSL or Docker.

We aim to improve cross-platform compatibility in the future releases.
