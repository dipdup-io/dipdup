Before starting indexing, you need to set up several things:

* Contracts you want to process with your indexer.
* Datasources used both by DipDup internally and user on demand.
* Indexes.

See [11.2. contracts](../config-reference/contracts.md) for details
See [11.4. datasources](../config-reference/datasources.md) for details
See [11.7. indexes](../config-reference/indexes/README.md) for details
