# 4.1.0

## ⚠ Migration from 3.x

* Optional: run `dipdup schema init` on the existing database to create missing views.

## What's New

### Index only the current state of big maps

`big_map` indexes allow achieving faster processing times than `operation` ones when storage updates are the only on-chain data your dapp needs to function. With this DipDup release, you can go even further and index only the current storage state, ignoring historical changes.

```yaml
indexes:
  foo:
    kind: big_map
    ...
    skip_history: never|once|always
```

When this option is set to `once`, DipDup will skip historical changes only on initial sync and switch to regular indexing afterward. When the value is `always`, DipDup will fetch all big map keys on every restart. Preferrable mode depends on your workload.

All big map diffs DipDup pass to handlers during fast sync have `action` field set to `BigMapAction.ADD_KEY`. Keep in mind that DipDup fetches all keys in this mode, including ones removed from the big map. You can filter out latter by `BigMapDiff.data.active` field if needed.

### New datasource for contract and token metadata

Since the first version DipDup allows to fetch token metadata from Better Call Dev API with `bcd` datasource. Now it's time for a better solution. Firstly, BCD is far from being reliable in terms of metadata indexing. Secondly, spinning up your own instance of BCD requires significant effort and computing power. Lastly, we plan to deprecate Better Call Dev API soon (but do not worry - it won't affect the explorer frontend).

Luckily, we have [dipdup-metadata](https://github.com/dipdup-net/metadata), a standalone companion indexer for DipDup written in Go. Configure a new datasource in the following way:

```yaml
datasources:
  metadata:
    kind: metadata
    url: https://metadata.dipdup.net
    network: mainnet|handzhounet
```

Now you can use it anywhere in your callbacks:

```python
datasource = ctx.datasources['metadata']
token_metadata = await datasource.get_token_metadata(address, token_id)
```

`bcd` datasource will remain available for a while, but we discourage using it for metadata processing.

### Nested packages for hooks and handlers

Callback modules are no longer have to be in top-level `hooks`/`handlers` directories. Add one or multiple dots to callback name to define nested packages:

```yaml
package: indexer
hooks:
  foo.bar:
    callback: foo.bar
```

After running `init` command, you'll get the following directory tree (shortened for readability):

```
indexer
├── hooks
│   ├── foo
│   │   ├── bar.py
│   │   └── __init__.py
│   └── __init__.py
└── sql
    └── foo
        └── bar
            └── .keep
```

The same rules apply to handler callbacks. Note that `callback` field must be a valid Python package name - lowercase letters, underscores, and dots.

### New CLI commands and flags

* `schema init` is a new command to prepare a database for running DipDip. It will create tables based on your models, then call `on_reindex` SQL hook to finish preparation - the same things DipDup does when run on a clean database.

* `hasura configure --force` flag allows to configure Hasura even if metadata hash matches one saved in database. It mighs come in handy during development.

* `init --keep-schemas` flag makes DipDup preserve contract JSONSchemas. Usually, they are removed after generating typeclasses with `datamodel-codegen`, but you can keep them to convert to other formats or troubleshoot codegen issues.

### Built-in `dipdup_head_status` view and REST endpoint
