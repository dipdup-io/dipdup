## Installation

This project is based on [DipDup](https://dipdup.io), a framework for building featureful dapps.

You need a Linux/macOS system with Python 3.12 installed. To install DipDup with uv or use our installer:

cp deploy/.env.default deploy/.env
# Edit .env file before running
make up
```

## Development setup
